[LICENSES FOR FDCLONE3]

(NOTICE:
 The official licenses is written in Japanese language. This
 version in English language is only a translation, and is
 NOT VALID LEGALLY.)


<0.Intro>

  This document is written for licenses to use, modify, duplicate,
and distribute `FDclone'.

  `FDclone' is a free software, not to restrict users to any
use. This document says the details based on each case, including
author's wishful desire.


<1.Definition>

  First of all, the terms used in this document are defined as
following. In this document, these terms are used in their
specific meanings written here, as long as there is no notice.

source
	A set of a source program. Or a set of a package which
	contained any document or something else in it.

binary
	An executable binary gotten with compiling a set of
	a source program. Or a set of a package which contained
	any document or something else in it.

distribution
	In a broad sense, to create the duplicate (if modified
	or not) of a source or a binary, and give the third
	party. In a narrow sense, to give the duplicate to the
	specific persons.

circulation
	A form of distribution in a broad sense. To give the
	duplicate of a source or a binary to the general public,
	widely at a public space.

primary distribution, primary circulation
	distribution (or circulation) by the hand of the author
	himself.

secondary distribution, secondary circulation
	distribution (or circulation) of the primary distribution
	or the primary circulation by the hand of someone except
	the author. It counts similarly as the 3rd distribution
	(or the 3rd circulation), the 4th distribution (or the
	4th circulation).

re-distribution, re-circulation
	A general term for distribution (or circulation) after
	the primary one.

modification
	To make several change on the original source or
	the binary.

secondary use
	To use a part of the original source, by including
	it in another software.


<2.Re-Distribution>

  About re-distribution in a narrow sense, re-distribution of
a source and a binary is permitted, if modified or not. You
can do it freely in any purpose, profit or not. Re-distribution
after the secondary one is as free as this.

  However, the author doesn't take any responsibility for the
re-distributed package. If you want any guarantees to keep
original or to work normally, the re-distributor himself will
needs to guarantee.


<3.Re-Circulation>

  Re-circulation of a source and a binary is permitted, if
modified or not. You can do it freely in any purpose, like
re-distribution in a narrow sense,

  But, in order to take care of the re-circulated package as
possible, a circulation registration system is established
for a part of circulation form. The author cannot take any
responsibility for the re-circulated one with no registration,
like the re-distributed one.
  The author takes care of the registered re-circulation
equivalent to the primary circulation. If you don't need
this, you don't have to make circulation registration.

  When you circulate the re-circulation already registered,
and don't make any modification on the package form and it's
contents against the registered re-circulation, the author
shall take care of it equivalent to the re-circulation.
  In the case of making some modification on the package,
at the moment you've done, circulation registration becomes
invalid. Then, the author doesn't take any responsibility,
unless circulation is registered again.

  However, if a secondary circulator adds some licenses on
the second circulation with registration, the licenses for
distribution after the secondary one follow them.
  If registered, a secondary circulator can freely set up
the licenses for re-distribution after the secondary one,
except they break the licenses for the primary circulation.
So, if you think to re-circulate the secondary circulation,
you should tell a secondary circulator.
  As far as circulation registration is made, the author will
keep out of re-distribution after the secondary one.


<4.Author's Responsibility>

  The author take care of the primary distribution and the
registered re-circulation.
  Specifically, replying to questions and requests from users,
changing the program if need, and guaranteeing that the
program never includes the operation against specifications
to work normally.
  If it doesn't work by according to specifications on each
document, the author should accept changing.

  The author doesn't take any responsibility for the
re-circulated packages with no registration, and cannot
reply to questions nor requests from users.
  If the contact from users occurs, it is hoped that the
re-circulator accepts the contact and manages it with
responsibility.

  However, the author guarantees no warranty in the use of
this program, each user will need to use it at their own
risk.


<5.Source Circulation Registration>

  The author take care of the unregistered circulation of a
source, only if the contents of its package have no
modification.
  The package which has some modification on its contents,
in which the program source part has no modification and its
modification is only the additional documents or programs,
will be treated equivalent to the case which has no
modification.
  In these cases, modification of package form is ignored,
that is modification of an archiving method or a package
name.

  When there is some modification in the program source part,
or in the files which have effect on the executable binary,
e.g. `Makefile' etc., source circulation registration will
make the author take care of it.
  You can make circulation registration according to the
following procedure.


<6.Binary Circulation Registration>

  The author doesn't take any responsibility for the circulation
of a binary, if it is re-circulation with no registration.
Even if it has no modification from the primary circulation,
it is the same.
  If you want any guarantees from the author, you need to make
circulation registration according to the following procedure,
if modified or not.

  It is suggested from the author that you will make surely
circulation registration, because the circulation of a binary
is especially dangerous.


<7.Adaptation of Program>

  When a user makes some modification partly on the program
and uses it, and treats as quite different from the original
program, it is regarded as secondary use, not depending on
the volume of modification.
  The modification which can not be regarded as the secondary
use follows above rule for re-distribution. On the other
hand, the secondary use can be treated freely as a work of
the secondary author.


<8.Broadcast through Books>

  It is regarded as re-circulation to broadcast through the
commercial books by the media, such as CD-ROM.
  If the author's guarantee is required, you should make
each circulation registration according to whether it is
a source or a binary. It is treated as same as the other
re-circulation.
  However, broadcasting the re-circulation already registered
doesn't need any registration again, then you should follow
the licenses by the circulator who made circulation registration.

  In case of not broadcasting but introducing as an article,
it has no need to register, because neither a guarantee nor
responsibility can be generated. No need to contact the
author.

  As the author's hope, it is preferable to contact or
contribute books if you broadcast or introduce.
  Especially in case of an introduction report, if you show
a manuscript in advance, the author will be able to confirm
whether it is suitable.
  Who intend to broadcast is be wanted to consider.


<9.Procedure of Circulation registration>

  If you want circulation registration, the following procedure
is authorized.

1. Define the circulation manager.
2. Rewrite from `NULL' to the E-mail address of the circulation
   manager, variable `distributor' in `version.h'.
   ex.:
   char *distributor = "shirai@unixusers.net (Takashi SHIRAI)";
3. Make the differential in modification from the package of
   the primary circulation, including the additional files if
   exist.
4. Create a circulation package.
5. Check the MD5 checksum of the package, and note it. In case
   of the binary circulation, check it for the executable binary
   of FDclone, too.
   If you have no way to check it, FDclone has a builtin command
   `checkid', so that you can use it. Compile and run FDclone,
   and push the `h' key for executing EXECUTE_SH command, and
   then run `checkid NAME_OF_FILE' to display the MD5 checksum.
6. Send the registration letter to the author via E-mail, with
   the differential and the package's MD5. In case of the binary
   circulation, you must refer to the environment(OS, machine,
   etc.) in which the circulated executable binary works, and
   MD5 of the executable binary.
7. Explain in the registration letter that you change the
   licenses of re-circulation, if need.

  In the registration letter, you should better declare whether
source circulation registration or binary circulation
registration. You can make source circulation registration
and binary circulation registration simultaneously in the same
registration letter.
  When you make binary circulation registration on multiple
environments with the same differential, listing each environment
can regard one registration as registration for all environment
simultaneously.

  If you are anxious about the operation in detail, please
tell the author before registration.
