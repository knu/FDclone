[CAUTION TO THE ADMINISTRATORS FOR FDCLONE3 EMPLOYMENT]


1.Employment Policy for FDclone

  Although FDclone is built aiming at the general purpose
tool for beginners, its intention is "compromise from UNIX
to beginners".
  In view of the present condition where someone complains
that it has only interface difficult for beginners, the target
is that any beginner can handle UNIX easily and any administrator
can be out of supporting beginners.

  I can hear some reactions in various places after the first
release of FDclone, and often feel that the above policy can
not be always kept in the actual employment.
  One of the worst case as employment seems "the system
administration with FDclone by a novice root".

  FDclone is only a tool for end users.

  The author has the policy that any root, even if he is a
novice, should be used to the UNIX world well.
  If he is used to FDclone in daily administrations, he will
not be able to raise the skill of the special operation in
some accidents and the shell programming.
  And the most important problem is a security. There is not
only the risk that a miss operation can cause damages widely,
but also the problem that FDclone operations is hard to be
traced later.

  If you nevertheless dare to operate as a root, I suggest
that you should record the log at least.
  FDclone has the function to record the log, which can
output to not only a file but also syslogd(8). The log level
of the root especially can be specified individually.
  If you specify this log setting in /etc/fd2rc and then
attribute readonly to the variables for the setting, no one
can avoid logging with changing settings after FDclone has
been invoked.

  You should keep a awareness of the problem for just root,
and walk on the road of UNIX administrator not invoking
FDclone with root permission easily.


2.Administration of End Users

  Although FDclone is a tool for beginners, the responsibility
for the beginner education in each environment cannot be
taken.
  The administrator who install FDclone take the minimum
responsibility in its employed environment, and need to
educate and enlighten end users including UNIX itself in
order to use FDclone correctly.
  FDclone is just only a tool.

  When you install FDclone, you must build the environment
where any end user can make use of FDclone with no special
knowledge.
  This means not only to consider the configuration of /etc/fd2rc
specialized in your environment, but also to build the
environment "kind to beginner" about the reference method
for a man page and FAQ.

  Therefore, the administrator who install FDclone will need
to have the minimum knowledge as the UNIX administrator.
  It seems the work of each administrator to support end users
in order to use FDclone comfortably. I wish you endeavor not
to neglect the beginner education and support with expecting
FDclone to be more than a tool.

  You should avoid that any complaint and question from end
users reach the author directly.
  Some mails are send to the author about not only the affair
specialized in FDclone but also the general question for UNIX.
A FDclone package includes FAQ about FDclone, and can hardly
include FAQ over whole UNIX.
  Moreover, even if it is a question about FDclone, the
direct mail from an end user requires a lot of explanation
filling his UNIX knowledge, and make difficult to support.
  It is recommended that the administrator in the employed
environment will administer the employment of FDclone, and
he send only the problem which will be resolved only by the
author.


3.Guarantees of FDclone

  FDclone has no warranty. The fact is that it is not checked
perfectly differing from some commercial products.
  Especially in the development after Ver. 1.03, the developing
environment becomes very poor for my personal reasons. I am
currently not a UNIX administrator but just end user who can
not have any root permission.
  Although it is very difficult to continue the development
of FDclone in such environment, I have continued the development
with a long time and earnest approval from some users.

  It still has poor implementation in the view of some UNIX
wizards, and may keep some security holes possibly. If you
have some anxiety for them, FDclone don't hold the reliability
enough to sweep off the anxiety.
  In opposite view, I propose that whose who expect such that
reliability should build the safer and more reliable tool
yourself.

  FDclone is not made by the engineer familiar with UNIX, and
just a tool made for hobby by a mere game designer in spare
time.
  Please don't expect FDclone too much on account of this
point.
