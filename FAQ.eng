[FAQ FOR FDCLONE3]


<1.UNIX Depended Problem>

Q1-01.	A long UNIX filename is not displayed to the end.
A1-01.	You can scroll a display position of a filename by
	`(' and `)' key, on the default key binding. Put a
	cursor on the objective file and push `)' key several
	times, to display the whole filename.

Q1-02.	When FDclone is finished, it is returned the startup
	directory. How I can do?
A1-02.	On UNIX OS, each process has their own current
	directories, and no child process can manage to change
	the current directory of its parent process.
	Since FDclone is started as a child process of your
	user shell, FDclone can never manage to change the
	current directory of the user shell, as its parent
	process.

	It is an ad hoc method that invoking from a shell
	with the form as "cd `fd`" can change the current
	directory when finished.
	In this case, specification as `trap "pwd" 0' in
	.fd2rc and so on causes outputting the current directory
	when finished, so that the parent shell who receives
	it will change its current directory.

Q1-03.	I want to page up/down by Shift + up/down key.
Q1-04.	I want to execute editors and executable files by
	Shift + Ret key.
Q1-05.	When I push Shift key, notation of a function line
	doesn't change.
A1-03.
A1-04.
A1-05.	On UNIX, a keyboard input is brought by the communication
	between a host and a terminal. Each terminal emulator
	or terminal itself defines what code is sent and
	received.
	A general terminal doesn't send any key code with the
	only Shift key. Only when it pushed with any other
	key, it sends the key code for Shift.
	Therefore, only when the key code for Shift is
	different from the original key code, it can be find
	whether Shift is pushed or not. It is defined by each
	terminal what key has this feature.
	And now, Ret and the cursor keys send the same code
	whether Shift is pushed or not.

Q1-06.	The owner/group name in the archive browser seems
	strange.
Q1-07.	The owner/group name seems strange, when the floppy
	drive is referred to.
A1-06.
A1-07.	The owner/group name of a file has a meaning only on
	the machine including it. On another machine, there is
	no guarantee to mean the same owner/group name.
	The owner/group name in archive files is named on the
	machine archiving them.
	Since MS-DOS has no such file attribute, there is
	not the owner/group name in files of the floppy drive.
	In that case, the owner/group name doesn't indicate
	any real owner/group. UNIX is implemented so that the
	owner/group name is treated as numeric, then it cannot
	be helped.

	(The tar which supports the new USTAR format can hold
	the owner/group name up to 32 characters in archives,
	to display the original owner/group name in the different
	environment.
	The ustar of System V and GNU tar are known as the tar
	which supports the USTAR format.)


<2.Customization Problem>

Q2-01.	I want to execute an external command according to the
	extension of a filename. Can I customize?
Q2-02.	How I can change the key binding?
A2-01.
A2-02.	Treat .fd2rc in your home directory as a configuration
	file. See man page for details of the usage.

Q2-03.	I can not set some key bindings.
A2-03.	The only key for which the special key identifier
	(See man page) is prepared can change its key binding.
	But, the builtin command "keymap" can make any key
	substitution of another function key, to set key binding
	in pseudo method.
	Key substitution by the edit mode is prior with key
	binding of a control character, so that there can be
	a control character to be unable to set key binding
	in some edit mode. If you need set in any way, you have
	to change the edit mode.
	And, It is forbidden to change ESC key binding, in order
	to avoid the problem that unusual change makes FDclone
	unterminatable.

Q2-04.	The display of a function key is different from an
	actual keyboard.
A2-04.	You can change a display of the function key when
	you change a key binding of the function key into
	your customization. See man page for details.
	But, if your keyboard layout is different from the
	function line, you can not suit a display to a
	keyboard. Sorry.

	(You can set up the function line layout with the
	internal variable (or the environment variable)
	FUNCLAYOUT, in Ver. 2.09 or later.)

Q2-05.	I want to confirm how it is customized.
A2-05.	You can confirm with some builtin commands in EXECUTE_SH
	command. For example, "printbind" for the key binding,
	"set" for the internal variable definition. See man
	page for details.

	(You can confirm and set up the configurations with
	the customizer all at once, in Ver. 2.00 or later.)

Q2-06.	As a system administrator, I want to prepare a
	configuration file common to users.
A2-06.	Make a file named /etc/fd2rc. It is referred to before
	the users .fd2rc is referred to, whether if .fd2rc exists
	or not.

Q2-07.	I want to register a new archive form in the archive
	browser. How can I do?
A2-07.	I've explained in #5 of TECHKNOW.eng, see it with the
	clause of "ARCHIVE BROWSER" in man page.

Q2-08.	It is always sorted.
Q2-09.	I want to see the information of a linked file in the
	case of a symbolic link.
Q2-10.	Some filenames are followed by a `*' or `/' character.
Q2-11.	A filename which starts with `.' is not displayed.
Q2-12.	I want to sort in the tree screen.
Q2-13.	The directory writing function takes no effect.
Q2-14.	When finished, my terminal configuration is different
	from the one before startup.
Q2-15.	I want to change the number of rows in startup.
Q2-16.	Can I get a longer filename field?
Q2-17.	I cannot use the command history.
Q2-18.	Can I refer to the history to input a pathname?
Q2-19.	I want to carry over the history to the next execution.
Q2-20.	A part the file list is not displayed in the tree screen.
Q2-21.	Can I see a second with the time display?
Q2-22.	I want to know the whole file size and the amount of
	disk.
Q2-23.	Can I use with color screen?
Q2-24.	I want to change the prompt in EXECUTE_SH command.
A2-08.
A2-09.
A2-10.
A2-11.
A2-12.
A2-13.
A2-14.
A2-15.
A2-16.
A2-17.
A2-18.
A2-19.
A2-20.
A2-21.
A2-22.
A2-23.
A2-24.	These configurations are set by the internal variables
	or the environment variables. There was not only the
	case each user configure them intentionally, but also
	the case the system administrator prepares the
	configuration file common to users, or hardcodes them
	when compiled. See the clause of "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
	in man page well, to set a suitable configuration by
	.fd2rc and so on.
	Moreover, an administrator should prepare a suitable
	common configuration file, not to confuse users like
	this. The configuration file in the distribution package
	is no more than sample, then make your own common
	configuration file with enough consideration.

Q2-25.	I cannot understand the edit mode.
A2-25.	It seems hard for who has used neither emacs nor vi
	to know why there are multiple methods for binding the
	substitutive key by the control character.
	If you want to suit to the original FD, you should
	define "wordstar" as the internal variable (or the
	environment variable) EDITMODE, without considering
	anything.
	Especially about vi mode, it is the just confused
	environment for except who is familiar to vi, then
	you should not set this configuration unless the
	special case.

Q2-26.	When I try to refer to a file in the archive browser,
	it is rejected as "No such file or directory".
Q2-27.	When I try to refer to a file in the floppy drive, it
	is rejected as "No such file or directory".
A2-26.
A2-27.	Is it right the value which is defined as the internal
	variable (or the environment variable) TMPDIR? It
	is necessary not only to exist the directory named
	as defined here, but also to be writable for you.
	Try to change the defined directory name, or change
	the permission of the directory.

Q2-28.	I can not use the floppy drive function.
A2-28.	Is it set up validly the configuration about the floppy
	drive? Even if you didn't set up when compiled, you can
	customize later.
	You must set the internal variable (or the environment
	variable) DOSDRIVE, and must register the floppy drive.
	See #6 of TECHKNOW.eng as details.
	And, sometimes a general user cannot use the floppy
	drive because of the permission of the device file
	assigned for the floppy disk drive. In this case, try
	to tell the administrator of a machine.

Q2-29.	Why the common configuration file is not located
	under /usr/local.
A2-29.	In some case, /usr/local is shared by some machines
	with NFS. If the common configuration file is located
	under /usr/local in such environment, multiple machines
	will use the same configuration file.
	There are not a few factors depended on machines in
	each configuration on FDclone, then I think it is
	sometimes unsuitable to be used the same configuration
	file by multiple machines.
	Therefore, it is designed to locate it under /etc
	which is rare to be used with NFS.
	If you understand the above and still want to locate
	it under /usr/local, as "Install" says, you may install
	with rewriting DEFRC in Makefile.in.

Q2-30.	What I should prepare as the common configuration
	file.
Q2-31.	I don't know what I should write in the configuration
	file.
A2-30.
A2-31.	It is no need to prepare /etc/fd2rc as the common
	configuration file, nor .fd2rc as the configuration
	file for each user.
	If you don't prepare them, it is valid the default
	configurations hardcoded in executable file. So
	these defaults is set with considering the difference
	from each OS, usually, it should run normally even
	if as is.
	If you make some strange configuration file with no
	understanding, or use the attached sample as it was,
	you may get into trouble. It will be wise to avoid
	preparing the configuration file meaninglessly.


<3.Environment Problem>

Q3-01.	When I try to refer to the contents of a file, page
	control is not managed, or a screen is broken.
A3-01.	It depends on the specification of a pager. If you
	change the pager software defined in the internal
	variable (or the environment variable) PAGER, the
	problem in reference will be cleared.
	I recommend, for example, GNU less distributed by
	FSF.

Q3-02.	Some special keys or function keys don't respond.
Q3-03.	DEL key and BS key has a strange behavior.
A3-02.
A3-03.	Perhaps the key code of special keys and function
	keys may be different from the expected one. See the
	man page of termcap(5) or terminfo(5), to re-register
	the entry for your terminal suitably.
	If you cannot access termcap/terminfo, the builtin
	command "keymap" can change the key code dynamically.
	Examine a key code of the object key to register,
	with the builtin command "getkey".
	On some terminals, pushing function keys don't cause
	to send any key code, but cause action of the screen
	copy and so on. On these terminals, you cannot use
	any function keys.

Q3-04.	It has been finished with a message as "Column size
	too small".
A3-04.	It means that the terminal column size is too small
	to display for FDclone, to force it to terminate.
	Similarly, if the terminal line size is too small,
	its message is "Line size too small".
	Execute on wider terminal, or widen size more than
	34x8 in case of the variable-sized terminal such
	as a window terminal.
	In case of variable-sized terminal, if you shorten
	a terminal size less than this while running, you
	should note that you will be prompted to widen a
	terminal size.

Q3-05.	I cannot read a kanji because it is broken.
A3-05.	Perhaps it may be compiled at a wrong kanji code, or
	you execute it in the terminal which use the different
	kanji code.
	In the latter case, set any of sjis, jis, or euc to
	the internal variable LANGUAGE, according to your
	terminal. FDclone will change the code internally.
	In the former case, you must re-compile with modifying
	the original kanji code, but you can manage like as
	the latter case in half measures. In this case, I
	think that it occurs some troubles to refer to the file
	with kanji filename or the Japanese man page.

	(Kanji filename will also be converted dynamically
	according to the internal variable FNAMEKCODE, in
	Ver. 2.00 or later.)

Q3-06.	When I bring it to a machine with the different
	environment, it works strangely.
A3-06.	It is generally the principle to re-compile for the
	different environment. Even if it may seem the same
	apparently, some troubles will be occurred in spite of
	just running because of the difference of OS version
	or the difference of configuration.
	Besides, don't forget to compile after executing
	"make clean", not to remain the previous unfinished
	file.

Q3-07.	I do "make config", but cannot compile normally.
A3-07.	Auto configuration is not perfect. Then see #1 of
	TECHKNOW.eng to modify config.h manually. It needs you
	have some knowledge of the C language, but each man page
	guides you without the advanced knowledge.
	If you use the OS which is written as the supported OS
	in Install, "make config" may sometimes makes a
	rather unsuitable configuration, so that you should not
	do "make config". When you've done accidentally, do
	"make realclean".
	If you can make configuration of config.h for any
	unsupported OS, you can report this to make me register
	it as the supported OS.
	But, I cannot support basically the environment which
	I don't have, then you must abandon it if it was
	imperfect in spite of modifying config.h. If you
	prepare me the developing environment with hardware,
	I will support it.

Q3-08.	I execute "man fd", but man page is not displayed
	correctly.
A3-08.	It is a possibility that the man page is not installed
	correctly. Did you prepare MANDIR which you've reserved
	in Makefile.in?
	Or it may be imperfect configurations about a kanji
	code. Try to confirm if you set correctly the environment
	variable such as MANPATH or LANG in user environment.
	In the worst case, It supposed that your OS is not
	supported in Japanese. Though the terminal itself
	can display Japanese, a text formatter (usually nroff)
	may be unable to use Japanese rightly.
	In this case, install a man page of the plain text
	version, referring to Install #8.

Q3-09.	The archive browser cannot display correctly only the
	timestamp of a file.
A3-09.	Try to exit from FDclone and do manually "tar tvf
	<FILENAME>". I suppose that date and time will be
	display in Japanese.
	Such a form of the timestamp is not recognized correctly,
	so that execute "export LANG=C" in .fd2rc and so on,
	to let tar done in English mode.
	Or, you may register the archive browser with any
	mistake, see enough #5 of TECHKNOW.eng or the clause
	of "ARCHIVE BROWSER" in man page.

	(The value of LANG will be changed automatically
	before executing archivers, in Ver. 2.04c or later.)

Q3-10.	I cannot read a file to the end.
A3-10.	Some pager, e.g. "more" which is a standard command
	included in OS, will immediately return to FDclone
	at the as soon as it has read through the end of a
	file, not to read to the end.
	In that case, you should use the "%K" macro in order
	to prompt once before returning.
	Specifically, you should add 2 characters "%K" after
	a pager name at the point to set up the internal
	variable (or the environment variable) PAGER.

Q3-11.	I want to read the file from which a kanji code is
	different.
A3-11.	Conversion of a kanji code is the work by a pager,
	so that you must manage with the pager side. GNU less
	has iso-2022-jp patch which to recognize each kanji
	code automatically, you can find it in anonymous ftp
	sites.
	Or there are some kanji code filters to recognize
	automatically, such as nkf. It is a way to set up
	the internal variable (or the environment variable)
	PAGER as "nkf %C | less".

Q3-12.	One day suddenly, a browser display of an archive file
	becomes	strange.
A3-12.	LHa on UNIX has been changed for a format to display
	in list from V 1.14. You should register a launcher
	as follows.
	launch ".lzh" "lha -lq" "%a %u/%g %s %x %m %d %{yt} %f"

	GNU tar has been changed for a format to display in
	list from version 1.12. You should register a launcher
	as follows.
	launch ".tar" "tar tvf" "%a %u/%g %s %y-%m-%d %t %f"
	launch ".tar.Z" "tar tvfZ" "%a %u/%g %s %y-%m-%d %t %f"
	launch ".tar.gz" "tar tvfz" "%a %u/%g %s %y-%m-%d %t %f"

	Both samples are prepared in _fdrc.

Q3-13.	When executed on winterm terminal of IRIX, neither
	Ret key nor a cursor key takes no effect.
A3-13.	It is the cause that description for winterm is
	wrongly prepared by the standard.
	You should add the following description in
	/etc/fd2rc
		if [ " $TERM" = " iris-ansi" ]; then
			keymap	ENTER	""
			keymap	UP	"\033OA"
			keymap	DOWN	"\033OB"
			keymap	RIGHT	"\033OC"
			keymap	LEFT	"\033OD"
		fi
	To explain additionally, this ENTER means Enter key
	of a special key, and never means Ret key (so-called
	new-line key).
	Although some keyboards have Ret key (mostly located
	above a right SHIFT) on which stamped "Enter" with
	its key-top, Enter key mentioned here is a special key
	prepared in some other keyboards, unlike this. It
	may be called as a send key.
	It seems the main cause of this trouble that this
	confusion occurred in the implementation of IRIX.

Q3-14.	Although compiled on BSD on Windows 1.5, it is regarded
	as FreeBSD, so that a kanji code is set to EUC-JP
	instead of Shift JIS.
A3-14.	Because there is a trouble in the installer of BSD
	on Windows 1.5, which an identifier due to be
	pre-defined is not defined.
	You should copy the following file.
	source:("X" is the drive letter where BOW CD-ROM exists)
	/dfs/X/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/i386--freebsd/2.6/specs
	destination:
	/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/i386--freebsd/2.6.2/specs

Q3-15.	I've got a FDclone circulated as binary, but it is
	not work well.
A3-15.	It is a rule to prepare the circulation manager for
	binary circulation, in FDclone Ver. 1.03 or later.
	When you execute such a binary, the version number
	in a title line must suffix the character of `#'.
	The author guarantees no warranty for the binary
	without this display.
	The binary with this display will show an address of
	the circulation manager on the function line of a
	help screen, so that try to push `?'.
	When some trouble has occurred about a circulated
	binary, you should contact with simultaneously not
	only the author but also this circulation manager.

Q3-16.	I'm a MS-DOS user without compile environment.
A3-16.	You can get a executable binary package compiled
	by LSI C-86 3.5 from the following URL.  And this
	URL will provide you the package to compile them
	automatically with DJGPP.

	(Sorry, this URL page is written by Japanese only.)

	http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA012337/soft/fd/

Q3-17.	A screen is too broken to operate anything on MS-DOS
	version.
A3-17.	Is ANSI.SYS set up? A general MS-DOS screen except
	the MS-DOS prompt on Windows can never work terminal
	I/O exactly, unless ANSI.SYS is set up.
	Since the startup disk of Windows95 has also no
	ANSI.SYS, you should set it up manually by rewriting
	CONFIG.SYS.
	Don't forget to prepare ANSI.SYS itself. For example,
	in the case of Windows95, it exists in the directory
	pointed out by the environment variable WINDIR.

	In the case of WindowsNT/2000, you should add
	"devicehigh=%SystemRoot%\system32\ansi.sys" in
	\WINNT\SYSTEM32\CONFIG.NT.

	(ANSI.SYS is not necessary, in Ver. 2.01 or later.)

Q3-18.	On Fujitsu UXP/DS, I cannot refer to a tar file by
	the archive browser.
A3-18.	Since tar on UXP/DS is special in the output form
	about the file mode, you cannot use an archive browser
	format for the other SVR4 type OS.
	The format hardcoded by the default can treat this
	special output form, but you should describe with
	care in the format when writing to .fd2rc etc.
	manually.

	Moreover, on UXP/DS V10, the output of tar is token
	out to stderr instead of stdout. For this reason,
	you have to order redirection as "2>&1" in .fd2rc
	etc.

	Both samples are prepared in _fdrc.

Q3-19.	On MS-DOS, the special key inputted for the first
	time after startup is ignored.
A3-19.	Some of SMARTDRV.EXE which is included MS-DOS made
	by NEC, seems specified to hook the keyboard BIOS
	and intercept an input character. I don't know this
	reason.
	This intercepted key input is returned to the key
	buffer for MS-DOS after a certain processing. Since
	this key buffer is invisible when the keyboard BIOS
	is used, the key input will be thrown away.
	Although this key input can naturally also be read
	if using only MS-DOS function call, MS-DOS made by
	NEC is specified that a cursor key cannot be got unless
	the keyboard BIOS is used.
	Then, I prepared in 1.03h the technique to get key
	input with MS-DOS function call, referring to the
	work memory for the keyboard BIOS.
	Although this technique is effective only on PC-9800
	series, if this condition occurs in another environment,
	you can add the following line to the head of term.c,
	to recompile.
		#define	NOTUSEBIOS

Q3-20.	On MS-DOS, I don't want to use Long File Name. How
	can I do?
A3-20.	If a capital letter is used like "C:\" as a drive
	letter of the object directory name, it comes to
	use Short File Name forcibly.
	Or it is one way to disguise the version of OS and
	pretend that OS is before MS-DOS 7.0 (MS-DOS included
	in Windows95) which supports LFN.
	You can drive it to answer an old version to FDclone,
	using SETVER.EXE included OS like the following.
		setver fd.exe 6.2
	But, you must note that the effect of SETVER.EXE
	will not be taken unless you describe the following
	line in CONFIG.SYS and reboot OS.
		DEVICE=[drive:][path]SETVER.EXE

Q3-21.	On PC-UNIX, I've used a MS-DOS filesystem with mounting,
	which doesn't accord with the contents seen by the
	floppy drive.
A3-21.	It is generally forbidden to access a single medium
	with multiple ways, so that you must not use the
	floppy drive function to the mounted disk.
	It is a general solution to use after "umount", or to
	give up using the floppy drive function.
	When you want to use simultaneously in the knowledge
	of danger, I write about the details of these situation
	on #9 of TECHKNOW.eng, so you can refer to it.

Q3-22.	On Solaris, when I am going to use the floppy drive,
	to be unable to access with a message as "Device busy.".
A3-22.	Doesn't vold (Volume Management daemon) work? Since
	this daemon automatically use a floppy disk device,
	FDclone try to use it, and cannot access because
	already under use.
	You can edit /etc/vold.conf to delete all the lines
	including the string "floppy", and reboot. Or the
	same effect is taken by sending SIGHUP to running
	vold instead of rebooting.
	However, this configuration will make some of
	standard floppy disk control commands unavailable.

	Moreover, if you are going to substitute /dev/rfd0a
	because /dev/rfd0c is unavailable owing to vold, the
	last cylinder of a floppy disk will be unable to
	access. Don't use rfd0a.

Q3-23.	On PC-DOS (IBM-DOS), strange characters sometimes
	appear in screen, like as ">5h" or ">5l".
A3-23.	PC-DOS (IBM-DOS) standard ANSI.SYS is inferior to
	MS-DOS one in some functions, to display the invalid
	sequence as it is.
	PANSI.SYS, the ANSI.SYS emulator equivalent to MS-DOS
	one, has been released, you should better use it
	instead of standard ANSI.SYS.
	http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA003655/en/down.html

	(ANSI.SYS is not necessary, in Ver. 2.01 or later.)


<4.Specification Problem>

Q4-01.	Can't I save the history of a pathname?
A4-01.	Although I added the pathname history in Ver. 1.03,
	this is not the history of input lines but the
	history of directories operated by commands.
	Because of its feature, it should not be carried
	over to the next FDclone execution, and occurs
	troublesome problems such as management of a save
	file, the pathname history has been made into the
	specification not to save.

	(You can set up to save the history of a pathname with
	the internal variables (or the environment variables)
	SAVEDIRHIST and DIRHISTFILE, in Ver. 2.09 or later.)

Q4-02.	Value by INFO_SYSTEM command may sometimes become "?".
A4-02.	There is the case that it cannot get any file system
	information by the specification of OS. In this case
	it displays as "?", but, since it has been so on the
	convenience of OS, there is no way to manage for
	FDclone.

Q4-03.	Can I mark also a directory?
A4-03.	If allowed to mark a directory, a damage when the user
	has been mistaken in operation will be large. As a
	safe policy, it is forbidden to mark a directory.
	In addition, it must be such specification also by
	the original "FD".

Q4-04.	When I chose "*" as a lookup string, the file which
	starts with `.' will be excepted.
A4-04.	UNIX shell is implemented not to match the file
	starts with `.' to the wildcard pattern "*". FDclone
	also follows this specification.
	Incidentally, it can generally make the file starts
	with `.' match to lookup with the string ".??*".
	Moreover, you should confirm whether if you make the
	file starts with `.' invisible, using DOTFILE_MODE
	command.

Q4-05.	When I upgrade to Ver. 2.00, configuration completely
	has changed from the previous.
A4-05.	In Ver. 2.00, a great specification change was given
	to the form of the internal command which is used in
	EXECUTE_SH and .fd2rc. You cannot use .fdrc of Ver.
	1.03 or before as it is, and should rewrite referring
	to man page or _fdrc.dif etc.

Q4-06.	I found a bug.
A4-06.	Please report the following address via E-mail.
		<shirai@unixusers.net>
	If I find the solution, will fix the bug on the next
	version.

Q4-07.	When sorted, only directories always come previous.
Q4-08.	When in the tree screen, even if I set up to sort a
	current directory always comes to a head.
A4-07.
A4-08.	It is made such specification.

Q4-09.	Although I set up to display Japanese both in compile
	and in execution, some English error messages are
	displayed.
A4-09.	Among the error messages output, the one in
	connection with the fundamental part of OS, e.g.
	filesystem etc., uses the error string in the library
	prepared by OS.
	Therefore, when OS supports Japanese, conversely,
	any Japanese error messages may be displayed even if
	you set up to display English.
	This error message is quite closely related to the
	function specification of OS, and message specification
	differs with OS in details. For this reason, it is
	very difficult to predict possible errors in advance
	and to prepare the error messages correspondent to
	them.
	Then, an original error message is prepared only
	about the error which can be enough predicted, and
	the other error messages use established one, in its
	specification.
	In addition, it seems that the details of each error
	message can be referred to by "man 2 intro", in many
	cases.

Q4-10.	The contents of a ejected floppy disk are not updated
	even if it is written in the floppy drive.
A4-10.	Since the floppy drive function uses caches, a floppy
	disk may not actually be written immediately after
	accessing to write.
	You can execute REREAD_DIR command on the screen
	you are looking at the floppy drive, to forced flushing
	caches, thereby, it is actually written.
	Or also moving to directories other than the floppy
	drive can make it written actually. You should not
	eject a floppy disk until it is actually written.

Q4-11.	I have used the shell which can treat the logical
	directory described by symbolic links. While I invoke
	FDclone on the directory with symbolic links, the
	displayed pathname has indicated the physical directory.
A4-11.	It is the first thing you should understand that
	the function treating the logical directory is
	particular to each shell and is not general function
	over UNIX world.
	Any processes invokes from a shell cannot get a
	pathname of the logical directory held by the shell
	from other than the shell itself.
	Some shells will hold a pathname of the logical
	directory with PWD the shell variable, so that you
	can give it as the environment variable to FDclone
	who is a child process in order to tell this
	information.
	In this case, you can describe `[ -d "$PWD" ] && cd $PWD'
	in .fd2rc and so on to change the current directory
	when invoked to the directory explicitly specified
	by PWD the environment variable, and then the displayed
	pathname will be logical one.

	(The logical directory held with PWD will be refered
	automatically without this description, in Ver. 2.04
	or later.)

	By the way, referring to each shell, Bourne shell
	and ash cannot treat any logical directories. Korn
	shell and bash can treat the logical directory and
	hold its pathname with PWD the shell variable. zsh
	and tcsh export PWD as the environment variable by
	default.
	The history of csh is confusing. The original csh
	written by Bill Joy cannot treat the logical directory
	nor have PWD as the shell variable. The csh rewritten
	in 4.3BSD Net/2 and after this can treat the logical
	directory and export the pathname as PWD the environment
	variable.

Q5-01.	I've lost the source.
A5-01.	It is confirmed that it exists in the following URL
	at present. You can get it from there.

	http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA012337/soft/fd/
	ftp://ftp.unixusers.net/src/fdclone/
	ftp://ftp.vector.co.jp/pack/unix/util/file/filer/fd/

Q5-02.	I have a question which has not appeared in FAQ.
A5-02.	Really? Over 90% of question mails brought after
	FDclone release is indicated by the included documents,
	and the most of them was the question as it is in
	this FAQ.
	It is not bad to ask others what you don't know, but
	doing it yourself as possible is the mutual-aid spirit
	supporting the Internet.
	You should better read documents over once again
	before writing a question mail. And if you have
	something that you cannot understand anyway, please
	send me a question mail unreservedly.
