     FFdd is a file & directory maintenance tool considered for the
     text terminals on general UNIX.  It aims for a clone of the
     same named utility which is made for the PC/AT compatible
     machine and PC-9800 series.  In fact, it is upper compatible
     functionally.

     FFdd shows the browser screen listing files when you have
     invoked it.  You can input some key which is bound each com-
     mand, to execute various operations.

     (In the following description, ((UUNNIIXX)) means that the opera-
     tion is implemented only on UNIX version and not effective
     on MS-DOS version.  As well as it, ((DDOOSS)) means that the
     operation is implemented only on MS-DOS version.)

     OOppttiioonnss
     The command line option is used for setting internal shell
     operations and setting the internal variables described
     below.  You can use any variable name as the internal vari-
     able, but ffdd can accept only those which are described in
     the below section of EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS.  If you specify
     _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y, the current directory is moved to the directory
     initially.  If you specify _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_2 _._._., the split window
     mode is invoked, and the current directoris of the supple-
     mental windows are moved to the each directory.

     The following options are available for the internal shell.

     --cc _s_t_r_i_n_g
          Commands described by _s_t_r_i_n_g are executed and exit
          immediately.  It is effective only when it is invoked
          as ffddsshh.

     --ii   If the --ii flag is present or if the standard
          input/output is a terminal, the shell is interactive
          shell.

     --ss   If the --ss flag is present or if no _a_r_g_s is specified,
          commands for the shell are read from the standard
          input.  Any remaining argument specifies the positional
          parameter.

     --rr   The shell is a restricted shell.  Specifically, the
          following operations are disallowed.

     FFdd has the 3 major screen modes.  In the browser screen, you
     can select from the file list and execute each command.  In
     the archive browser screen, files in the archive file are
     listed separately by directory, and you can browse as well
     as the browser screen.  In the tree screen, you can move on
     the directory tree and select the directory path.

     In all screen modes, each 33 lines on the top/bottom of the
     screen are used for the various information of ffdd.. The top
     information lines sometimes become 44 lines.  The screen lay-
     out is the following.

     line#     Description

     11         The title line.  The clock at the right end is
               updated every 1100 seconds.

     22         The information line.  It displays informations in
               this order: the current page (and the total
               pages), the number of marks (ant the total marks),
               the sorted type, the pattern string for file
               search.

     33         The path line.  It displays the fullpath of the
               current directory.  In the archive browser screen,
               it displays the fullpath of the archive file and
               the current path in the archive.

     22 (optional)
               The file size information line.  It displays the
               total size of the marked files in the directory
               (and the total size of all files), the total capa-
               city and the free size of the file system includ-
               ing the current directory.  This line appears by
               SSIIZZEEIINNFFOO the internal variable setting.  When
               this line is displayed, The information line and
               the path line are displayed 1 line under each.

     bboottttoomm -- 22
               The stack line.  It displays files temporarily
               which you push in stack, when arranging files.

     bboottttoomm -- 11
               The function line.  It displays the operations of
               function keys.

     bboottttoomm    The status line.  It displays the status of the
               file on the cursor position.  It also displays
               warning messages when command is executed with
               some troubles.

     You can use the following internal commands on ffdd.  While
     any user can change the key binding for these internal com-
     mands, here shows the default key binding.  The identifier
     is used when it is executed from the command line of
     EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH command, and when the user defines the key bind-
     ing.

     The detail of each internal command is the following.
     Internal commands with similar function are described
     together.

        MMoovvee ccuurrssoorr
             Move a cursor.

        TTuurrnn ppaaggee
             Turn to the previous/next page, when files are not
             completely held in a screen.  Also if you try to
             move out of the page with Cursor move, the page will
             be turned.

        MMoovvee ttoo tthhee ttoopp//bboottttoomm
             Move a cursor to the top/bottom of the file list.
             When the list is not held in a screen, the page is
             turned.

        SShhiifftt ffiilleennaammee
             Shift the displayed string of filename on the cursor
             position, when the filename is longer than the
             prepared column width.  It is displayed as shifted
             to right/left by 1 character.  The display of the
             status line is also shifted simultaneously.

        CChhaannggee llaayyoouutt
             Change the number of columns into each value.  There
             are usually 22 columns per screen.  As the column
             width per file is changed according to the number of
             columns, the displayed information is also changed.

        MMaarrkk ffiillee
             Mark the file on the cursor position.  You cannot
             mark any directory.  [SSppaaccee] marks and moves down a
             cursor.  [^^SSppaaccee] also marks and moves down a cur-
             sor, but doesn't turn the page.  [HHoommee] marks all
             the files, [EEnndd] marks all the files reversely.  [**]
             additionally marks the file which matches the wild-
             card.  You must input the wildcard string whenever
             you push [**].

             Marked files are used as the target of AATTTTRR_FFIILLEE,
             CCOOPPYY_FFIILLEE, DDEELLEETTEE_FFIILLEE, MMOOVVEE_FFIILLEE, UUNNPPAACCKK_FFIILLEE and
             the user defined command macros.

             [RReettuurrnn] changes the current directory to the direc-
             tory on the cursor position.  If you want to change
             it to the parent directory, you should move a cursor
             to the file of ".." and push [RReettuurrnn], or simply
             push [BBss].  [\\] changes the current directory to the
             root directory.

        PPuusshh//ppoopp ffiillee ssttaacckk
             [DDeell] pushes the file on the cursor position to the
             file stack, and temporarily deletes the file from
             the file list screen.  You can push files to the
             file stack up to 55 files.

             [IInnss] pops the file from the file stack and insert
             it on the cursor position.  The last pushed file is
             popped first.  But this order is expediently
             displayed in ffdd, and it is reset by Directory move.

        RReeddrraaww ssccrreeeenn
             Redraw the file list screen by rereading the infor-
             mation of the current directory.  It is useful when
             some other process add/delete files, or when some-
             thing break the screen display.

             Moreover, when you use the terminal which doesn't
             raise SSIIGGWWIINNCCHH signal at changing the screen size
             (like kktteerrmm(1) on HP-UX etc.), you must intention-
             ally redraw after you change the screen size.

        CChhaannggee llooggiiccaall ddiirreeccttoorryy (Logdir)
             Change the current directory to the inputted path-
             name.  When you input the pathname which starts with
             '/', it means not the relative move but the absolute
             move.

             When you input the pathname "..", the pathname of the
             current directory is adjusted into absolute expres-
             sion.  Except this case, the current directory
             always is shown as the virtual pathname, by reason
             of a link and so on.  When you input the pathname
             "??", you can move to the current directory when ffdd
             was invoked.  When you input the pathname "--", you
             can move to the last visited directory.

             Moreover, When you input the pathname "@@" in floppy
             drive, you can move to the directory on UNIX file
             system, where you existed before moving to floppy
             drive.  ((UUNNIIXX))

             (Note: This command is called as "Loddsk" in the
             original FD on MS-DOS, which is short for "LOGical
             DiSK drive".  This "logical" means the drive name
             prefixed to pathnames, and it is virtually named
             against "physical disk drive".  On UNIX, since "log-
             ical disk drive" never means pathname nor directory,
             this command name "Change logical directory" is not
             suitable.  But this name is expediently inherited
             from the original version.)

        EExxeeccuuttee ffiillee (eXec)
             Execute the file on the cursor position with some
             parameters, as the child process.  The cursor posi-
             tion in command line exists after the filename in
             case of the executable file, and before the filename
             except it.  You should fill suitable parameters or
             command name in each case.  The up/down cursor keys
             can provide the command history which you executed
             before.

             On MS-DOS version, the LFN form filename in the com-
             mand line which is quoted with the quotation mark ""
             is automatically replaced into 8+3 form filename
             before execution.  In this case, when there is the
             filename described by the string quoted with "", this
             string is always replaced into 8+3 form filename
             after deleting "", otherwise it is never replaced
             including "".

        CCooppyy ffiillee (Copy)
             Copy the file on the cursor position to the speci-
             fied directory.  When the cursor position indicates
             a directory, its contents are copied recursively.
             When some files are marked, the target is not the
             file on the cursor position but the marked files.

             When the same named file exists in the destination,
             you can select the operation from the following:
             "Update (by timestamp)", "Rename (each copied
             file)", "Overwrite", "Not_copy_the_same_name", "For-
             ward".  If you select "Forward", you should specify
             the directory as the destination to forward.  All
             files which have the same names are moved to the
             specified directory.

        DDeelleettee ffiillee (Delete)
             Delete the file on the cursor position.  No direc-
             tory can be deleted.  When some files are marked,
             the target is not the file on the cursor position
             but the marked files.

             When you don't have write permission on the file,
             you are confirmed for security.

        RReennaammee ffiillee (Rename)
             Rename the file on the cursor position.  You cannot
             rename to the same name as any existent file.  When
             you specify the pathname with some directory name,
             it is also moved to the directory.

        SSoorrtt ffiillee (Sort)
             Sort files in the current directory.  You can select
             the sorted type from the following: "fileName",
             "Extension", "Size", "Timestamp", "Length (of
             filename)", and specify "Up (incremental order)" or
             "Down (decremental order)".  When the sorted type
             before sorting is the one except "No chg (not
             sort)", the choice will include "No chg".  When you
             sort after sorting another sorted type, the previous
             sorted result is based in sorting.  This sorting has
             a priority except specified type, the directory is
             always precedes any file, except for the case of "No
             chg".  In case of "Length", files which have the
             same filename length are sorted in order of their
             names.

             But this sorting is expediently displayed in ffdd, and
             it is reset by Directory move.

        FFiinndd ffiillee (Find)
             Find the files matching the wildcard, and display
             only them.  The filename which starts with '.'
             doesn't match the wildcard which starts with '*' nor
             '?'.  If you want to cancel the File find, you
             should move the current directory, or do FFIINNDD_FFIILLEE
             again and input a null line.

             When the current directory has the files which have
             the extension registered to associate with an
             archive browser, the string which starts with '/' is
             used to find not the filename but the filename in
             archive files, and only the archive files which con-
             tain matched files are displayed.  This function is
             available in the archive browser.

             After Find file, you can not do WWRRIITTEE_DDIIRR.

        DDiissppllaayy ttrreeee ssccrreeeenn (Tree)
             Display the directory tree based on the current
             directory.  You can select the directory in the tree
             screen, to move the current directory.

        EEddiitt ffiillee (Editor)
             Edit the file on the cursor position.  The editor is
             used referring EEDDIITTOORR the internal variable, or
             referring EEDDIITTOORR the environment variable when the
             internal variable is undefined.

        UUnnppaacckk ffiillee (Unpack)
             Unpack the archive file on the cursor position into
             the specified directory.  In builtin configuration,
             you can unpack only the tar file and its compressed
             file and the LHa compressed file.  You can describe
             configurations in the initial configuration file to
             support archivers except these.

        CChhaannggee aattttrriibbuuttee (Attr)
             Change the file access mode, the timestamp and the
             owner/group of the file on the cursor position.
             When some files are marked, the target is not the
             file on the cursor position but the marked files.
             In case of the marked files, you must select the
             mode, the timestamp or the owner/group, before chang-
             ing it all together.

             When you input the mode, cursor keys move a cursor
             to the position you want to change, [SSppaaccee] reverses
             the attribute on the position.  You should notice
             that the attribute of the execution bit is not a
             binary toggle but a triple toggle, which includes
             setuid bit, setgid bit and sticky bit respectively.
             If the target is the marked files, [mm](Mask) will
             mask a bit on the cursor position with '**', to keep
             the value of the original file attribute.  When you
             input the timestamp, you move a cursor to the posi-
             tion you want to change, and input a numeric value.
             When you input the owner/group, you move a cursor to
             the position for each name, and input a name or a ID
             value with [SSppaaccee].  You can use the completion for
             a user name and a group name to input each name.  Fi-
             nally, [RReettuurrnn] executes the change.  You can cancel
             with [EEsscc].  Be careful that the limit check of date
             is not perfect.

             Moreover, [aa](Attr), [dd](Date), [tt](Time),
             [oo](Owner) and [gg](Group) move a cursor to the each
             beginning of input line.

             On the OS which has the attribute of file flags, you
             can change the file flags as well as the mode.  In
             this case, [ff](Flag) move a cursor to the beginning
             of input line of file  flags.  But the value of
             flags which you can change is based on your permis-
             sion.

        FFiillee ssyysstteemm iinnffoorrmmaattiioonn (Info)
             Display the information of the specified file sys-
             tem.  When the inputted pathname is not the special
             file which indicates a file system, the information
             of the file system including the pathname is
             displayed.

        MMoovvee ffiillee (Move)
             Move the file on the cursor position to the speci-
             fied directory.  When the cursor position indicates
             a directory, the directory itself is moved.  When
             some files are marked, the target is not the file on
             the cursor position but the marked files.

             When the same named file exists in the destination,
             you can select the operation as well as CCOOPPYY_FFIILLEE.
             When the destination belongs to the different file
             system, copy and delete are just executed continu-
             ously.

        DDeelleettee ddiirreeccttoorryy (rmDir)
             Delete the directory on the cursor position recur-
             sively.  When the directory in a symbolic link, only
             the link is deleted and the linked directory has no
             effect.

        MMaakkee ddiirreeccttoorryy (mKdir)
             Make the sub directory on the current directory.
             When the inputted sub directory string includes '/',
             which is the pathname delimiter, it goes on making
             directory recursively until the directory described
             by the string is finally created.

             When you input the pathname which starts with '/',
             the directory is made not on the current directory
             but on the absolute path described.

        EExxeeccuuttee cchhiilldd pprroocceessss (sHell)
             Execute the inputted command string as the child
             process, by handling the internal shell.  You can
             refer the command history and use automatic LFN
             replacement, as well as EEXXEECCUUTTEE_FFIILLEE.  When you push
             only [RReettuurrnn] without any input, the user shell
             which is described by SSHHEELLLL the internal variable or
             the environment variable is invoked.  In this case,
             you should input "eexxiitt" to return to ffdd.  When the
             value of SSHHEELLLL is ffddsshh, the internal shell is exe-
             cuted as the interactive shell.

             However, when there is the same command name as a
             builtin command or a internal command, the builtin
             command or the internal command are executed instead
             of the external command.  You can refer the clause
             of `BBuuiillttiinn CCoommmmaannddss' for the details of the builtin
             command.

        WWrriittee ddiirreeccttoorryy (Write)
             Write the displayed directory.  The gap between
             files on the directory entry is filled.  When it is
             executed after arranged by PPUUSSHH_FFIILLEE, PPOOPP_FFIILLEE and
             SSOORRTT_DDIIRR, the result is written.

             When the displayed directory doesn't belong to the
             hierarchy under your home directory, you are con-
             firmed for security whether if any other user
             doesn't use the directory.  Since it is insecure,
             you cannot write the NFS mounted directory and some
             special directories.

             If you execute the internal command which arranges
             the file order, and then try to execute the internal
             command which will break that order, you will be
             confirmed whether if you write the directory or not,
             just before the internal command is executed.  For
             this function, you can write the directory without
             intentionally executing this Directory write com-
             mand.  But when the displayed directory is not under
             your home directory, this confirmation is not done.

        BBaacckkuupp ttaappee (Backup)
             Backup the file on the cursor position into the
             specified storage device.  When the cursor position
             indicates a directory, all of its contents is back-
             uped.  When some files are marked, the target is not
             the file on the cursor position but the marked files.

             TTaarr(1) is used for backup.  When you specify the
             filename except special files indicates devices as
             input of the device name, the archive file is
             created with that filename.

        VViieeww ffiillee (View)
             View the file on the cursor position.  The pager is
             used referring PPAAGGEERR the internal variable, or
             referring PPAAGGEERR the environment variable when the
             internal variable is undefined.

        PPaacckk ffiillee (Pack)
             Pack the file on the cursor position into the speci-
             fied archive file.  When the cursor position indi-
             cates a directory, all of its contents is packed
             into the archive file.  When some files are marked,
             the target is not the file on the cursor position
             but the marked files.

             According to the extension of the inputted archive
             file, the associated archiver is automatically
             selected.  In builtin configuration, you can pack
             only the tar file and its compressed file and the
             LHa compressed file.  You can describe configura-
             tions in the initial configuration file to support
             archivers except these.

             When you use ttaarr(1), you may sometimes be unable to
             pack a lot of files at once, because of the maximum
             parameter length which can be given at once.  In
             those case, you can create the archive file with
             BBAACCKKUUPP_TTAAPPEE.

        OOppeerraattiioonnss wwiitthh ttrreeee
             [LL], [CC], [MM] and [UU] can make you select the path-
             name from the directory tree instead of the string
             input.  They execute the internal command equivalent
             to LLOOGG_DDIIRR, CCOOPPYY_FFIILLEE, MMOOVVEE_FFIILLEE and UUNNPPAACCKK_FFIILLEE,
             respectively.

        FFiinndd ffiillee rreeccuurrssiivveellyy
             Find the file matching the wildcard recursively
             under the current directory, and move the directory
             where the found file exists.  When the cursor posi-
             tion indicates a directory, it find the file under
             the directory on the cursor position instead of the
             current directory.

             You will be confirmed for each matching file whether

             Change attributes the directory on the cursor posi-
             tion revursively.  As well as changing attributes of
             the marked files, you must select the mode, the time-
             stamp or the owner/group, before changing it all to-
             gether with each file under the directory.

             When you input the mode, you should notice that the
             attribute of the execution bit, in this case, is not
             a triple toggle but a 5-states toggle, which in-
             cludes 'XX' and '!!'.  'XX' means setting the bit only
             if the object is a directory or some execution bits
             are set.  '!!' also means unsetting the bit only if
             the object is a directory or some execution bits are
             set.  [mm](Mask) will mask a bit on the cursor posi-
             tion with '**', to keep the value of the original
             file attribute.

             the cursor position indicates a directory.  In buil-
             tin configuration, the archive browser is registered
             with the tar file and its compressed file and the

             split window mode in which the screen is split into
             2 windows vertically.  In the split window mode, you
             can operate works individually on each window.  When
             you split a window in the split window mode, the
             current working window is split into 2 windows ver-
             tically.  You can make split windows up to 55.

     In EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH and the initial configuration file, you can
     use the internal commands described above and the builtin
     commands described below, as well as the external commands.
     With these commands, a pipeline can consist of one or more
     commands separated by || or ||&&.  || connects the standard out-
     put of the previous command to the standard input of the
     next command.  ||&& connects both the standard output and the
     standard error output of the previous command to the stan-
     dard input of the next command.  The exit status of a pipe-
     line is the exit status of the last command.  You can start
     a pipeline with !!, then the exit status of a pipeline will
     be the logical NOT of the exit status of the last command.
     Moreover, a command list can consist of one or more pipe-
     lines separated by ;;, &&, &&||, &&&&, ||||.  This command list can
     end with ;;, && or &&||.  These separators mean the following.
        ;;    Execute commands sequentially.
        &&    Execute commands synchronously, not waiting for the
             preceding pipeline to finish.  ((UUNNIIXX))
        &&||   Same as &&, except to immediately ddiissoowwnn the job.
             ((UUNNIIXX))
        &&&&   Execute the following pipeline only if the preceding
             pipeline returns a 00 exit status.
        ||||   Execute the following pipeline only if the preceding
             pipeline returns a non-00 exit status.
     In these command lists, a newline means as same as ;;.

     The input/output of each command in the command list can be
     redirected with the following redirectees.  These
     redirectees can be placed on any position in the command
     string.
        _n<<_f_i_l_e    Redirect the input indicated by the file
                  descriptor _n into the input from _f_i_l_e.  If _n is
                  omitted, it is regarded as the standard input
                  is specified.
        _n>>_f_i_l_e    Redirect the output indicated by the file
                  descriptor _n into the output to _f_i_l_e.  If _n is
                  omitted, it is regarded as the standard output
                  is specified.  If _f_i_l_e doesn't exist it is
                  created, otherwise it is truncated to 0 length
                  before output.
        _n>>||_f_i_l_e   Same as >>, except to force to overwrite
                  existent files even if --CC option is set by sseett
                  the builtin command.

                  omitted, it is regarded as the standard output
                  is specified.  If _f_i_l_e doesn't exist it is
                  created, otherwise output is appended to it.
        _n_1<<&&_n_2    Redirect the input indicated by the file

                  file descriptor _n_2.  If _n_1 is omitted, it is
                  regarded as the standard output is specified.
        &&>>_f_i_l_e    Redirect both the standard output and the stan-
                  dard error output into the output to _f_i_l_e.  If
                  _f_i_l_e doesn't exist it is created, otherwise it
                  is truncated to 0 length before output.
        &&>>||_f_i_l_e   Same as &&>>, except to force to overwrite
                  existent files even if --CC option is set by sseett
                  the builtin command.
        &&>>>>_f_i_l_e   Redirect both the standard output and the stan-
                  dard error output into the output to _f_i_l_e.  If
                  _f_i_l_e doesn't exist it is created, otherwise
                  output is appended to it.
        _n<<>>_f_i_l_e   Redirect both the input/output indicated by the
                  file descriptor _n into the input/output from/to
                  _f_i_l_e.  If _n is omitted, it is regarded as the
                  standard input is specified.
        _n>><<_f_i_l_e   Redirect both the input/output indicated by the

        _n>><<--
        _n>><<&&--     Close both the input/output indicated by the
                  file descriptor _n.  If _n is omitted, it is re-
                  garded as the standard output is specified.
        _n<<<<[--]_w_o_r_d
                  Redirect the input indicated by the file
                  descriptor _n into the input which is read up to
                  a input line as same as _w_o_r_d, or to an end of
                  file.  If any part of _w_o_r_d is quoted, no input
                  line is evaluated.  Otherwise, each input line
                  is evaluated to expand variables or replace
                  strings.  When you specify --, all tabs on the
                  beginning of input lines is stripped to be send
                  to a command.  If _n is omitted, it is regarded
                  as the standard input is specified.

     When you specify the file with each redirect, you can de-
     scribe the filename as `_s_c_h_e_m_e::////_h_o_s_t::_p_o_r_t' form to open the

                  within the range determined by the OS is used.

     On each command line, the string from '##' to the end of line
     and a null line are ignored.  When the line ends with '\\',
     it is referred as continuing into the next line, so that you
     can split a long line with this.

     BBuuiillttiinn CCoommmmaannddss
     FFdd has the following builtin commands.  These builtin com-
     mands can be used in EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH and the initial configura-
     tion file.

     iiff _l_i_s_t tthheenn [eelliiff _l_i_s_t tthheenn _l_i_s_t] ... [eellssee _l_i_s_t] ffii
                   The _l_i_s_t of iiff clause and eelliiff clauses are
                   executed in order, and if each exit status is
                   a 0, then the _l_i_s_t of tthheenn clause associated
                   with it is executed and the eelliiff clauses after
                   it are ignored.  If no _l_i_s_t of iiff clause nor
                   eelliiff clauses return a 0, the _l_i_s_t of eellssee
                   clause is executed.  If no _l_i_s_t of tthheenn
                   clauses nor eellssee clause is executed, then iiff
                   returns a 00 exit status.

     wwhhiillee _l_i_s_t ddoo _l_i_s_t ddoonnee
                   The _l_i_s_t of wwhhiillee clause is executed repeat-
                   edly, and while its exit status is 0, the _l_i_s_t
                   of ddoo clause is executed repeatedly.  If the
                   _l_i_s_t of ddoo clause is never executed, then
                   wwhhiillee returns a 00 exit status.

     uunnttiill _l_i_s_t ddoo _l_i_s_t ddoonnee
                   The _l_i_s_t of uunnttiill clause is executed repeat-
                   edly, and while its exit status is NOT 0, the
                   _l_i_s_t of ddoo clause is executed repeatedly.  If
                   the _l_i_s_t of ddoo clause is never executed, then
                   uunnttiill returns a 00 exit status.

     ffoorr _N_A_M_E [iinn _v_a_l_u_e ...] ddoo _l_i_s_t ddoonnee
                   _N_A_M_E the internal variable is substituted for
                   values of _v_a_l_u_e one by one, and _l_i_s_t is exe-
                   cuted according to the each value.  If iinn
                   _v_a_l_u_e is omitted, then each positional
                   parameter is substituted one by one.

     ccaassee _w_o_r_d iinn [_p_a_t_t_e_r_n [|| _p_a_t_t_e_r_n] ... )) _l_i_s_t ;;;;] ... eessaacc
                   The string _w_o_r_d is compared with the each _p_a_t_-
                   _t_e_r_n, _l_i_s_t associated with the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n which
                   first matches it is executed.

     ((_l_i_s_t))        Execute _l_i_s_t in a sub shell.

     {{ _l_i_s_t;; }}     Execute _l_i_s_t in the current shell.

     _N_A_M_E==[_v_a_l_u_e] [_c_o_m ...]
                   Define a internal variable which is available
                   only in ffdd.  It substitutes the value (string)
                   _v_a_l_u_e for _N_A_M_E the internal variable.  When
                   you describe the command _c_o_m after the defini-
                   tion of a variable, _c_o_m is executed on the
                   state where this variable is regarded as the
                   environment variable.  In this case, the
                   definition of _N_A_M_E is not remain as the
                   environment variable nor the internal vari-
                   able.

                   If _v_a_l_u_e is omitted, the value of _N_A_M_E the
                   internal variable is defined as a null.  If
                   you want to delete the definition of a inter-
                   nal variable, use uunnsseett the builtin command.

     _n_a_m_e(()) {{ _l_i_s_t; }}
                   Define a function whose body is _l_i_s_t, as the
                   name of _n_a_m_e.  The defined function can be
                   used in the command line of EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH and
                   each command macro described below.  You can
                   use the positional parameter $$_n in each
                   description of _l_i_s_t, which indicates the argu-
                   ment when the function is invoked.  $$00 is _n_a_m_e
                   itself, and $$11-$$99 indicates each argument.

                   Although you cannot omit {{ }} and _l_i_s_t, you can
                   omit {{ }} before/after _l_i_s_t which consists of a
                   single command.  If you want to delete the
                   definition of a function, use uunnsseett the buil-
                   tin command.

     !!_n_u_m          Execute the command which has the history
                   number specified with the numeric value _n_u_m.
                   When _n_u_m is negative value, it executes the
                   command which has the history number as the
                   current history number minus _n_u_m.

     !!!!            Execute the previous command.  This is synonym
                   for !!--11.

     !!_s_t_r          Execute the command history which starts with
                   the string _s_t_r.

     :: [_a_r_g ...]   No effect.  But it evaluates _a_r_g and performs
                   redirection.

     .. _f_i_l_e
     ssoouurrccee _f_i_l_e   Read and evaluate commands from _f_i_l_e.  _F_i_l_e
                   must exists on the directory which PPAATTHH
                   includes, or be described with pathname.  The
                   each line format is based on the format of
                   EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH.  You can describe this in the file
                   as nesting.

     aacccceepptt [_f_d]   Accept the connection with the file descriptor
                   indicated by _f_d, and the connected socket will
                   be assign to _f_d of the same file descriptor.
                   At the same time, the accepted socket will be
                   closed.  When fd is not the redirection as the
                   form of bbiinndd::////, this command will be failed.
                   In comparison with the redirection as the form
                   of aacccceepptt::////, the shell can receive controls
                   before establishing connection to negotiate
                   the TCP port number with the remote host in ad-
                   vance.  ((UUNNIIXX))

                   If _f_d is omitted, the connection will be ac-
                   cepted with the standard input.

     aaddddccrr [--11] [_f_i_l_e]
                   Output the string read from the file specified
                   by _f_i_l_e, line by line.  The newline of each
                   line is unified into CR-NL (\r\n).  It is use-
                   ful to pipe the output to some socket.

                   If _f_i_l_e is omitted, it is regarded as the stan-
                   dard input is specified.  If --11 is specified,
                   it will output just 1 line and exit.

     aalliiaass [_n_a_m_e[==_c_o_m]]
                   Define a alias whose body is _c_o_m, as the name
                   of _n_a_m_e.  The defined alias can be used in the
                   command line of EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH and each command
                   macro described below.  The alias substitution
                   is performed recursively.

                   If _c_o_m is omitted, the alias of _n_a_m_e is
                   displayed.  If both _c_o_m and _n_a_m_e are omitted,
                   all the current alias definition list is
                   displayed.

     aarrcchh _e_x_t [_p_a_c_k _u_n_p_a_c_k]
                   Register the archiver command associated with
                   the archive file which has _e_x_t the extension.
                   The pack command is specified as _p_a_c_k, and the
                   unpack command is specified as _u_n_p_a_c_k, using
                   the macro representation quoted with "".  When
                   _e_x_t starts with //, uppercase/lowercase is
                   ignored in the comparison of any extension.

                   If both _p_a_c_k and _u_n_p_a_c_k are omitted, the
                   archiver command registration for _e_x_t the
                   extension is deleted.

     bbgg [_j_o_b]      Continue the execution of the job specified
                   with _j_o_b in the background.  The following
                   format is available to specify a job.  ((UUNNIIXX))
                         %%
                         %%++   the current job
                         %%--   the previous job
                         %%_n   the job with job number _n
                         %%_s_t_r the job whose command line starts with _s_t_r
                   But, you must describe these %% in the command
                   line of EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH as the duplicated expres-
                   sion, such as %%%%, for the reason of the param-
                   eter macro function described below.

                   If _j_o_b is omitted, the current job is contin-
                   ued in the background.

     bbiinndd _c [_c_o_m_1 [_c_o_m_2] [::_c_o_m_m_e_n_t]]
                   Bind the command _c_o_m_1 to the key _c.  When you
                   want to specify a control character for _c, you
                   can prefix ^^ into 2 characters, such as ^A.
                   When you want to specify a character with the
                   META key (or the ALT key on MS-DOS version),
                   you can prefix @@ into 2 characters, such as
                   @a.  When you want to specify a function key
                   and a special key, you can use each identifier
                   described in kkeeyymmaapp command after, such as
                   F10.  Or you can describe the escape sequence,
                   such as \\nn and \\ee, and the octal expression,
                   such as \\oooooo.

                   In case of binding the internal command of ffdd,
                   you can the command identifier as it is.  When
                   you want to define the internal command with
                   some arguments or define the command in the
                   macro representation, you should describe the
                   string quoted with "".  If _c_o_m_2 is not omitted,
                   _c_o_m_2 is executed when the cursor position
                   indicates a directory.  When the key _c is the
                   function key of F1-F20, if you describe _c_o_m_-
                   _m_e_n_t prefixed with :: trailing the command
                   description, you can change the display of
                   associated part in the function line into _c_o_m_-
                   _m_e_n_t.

                   However, note that, with the key binding for
                   the control key, the configuration in the edit
                   mode described below is prior to the key bind-
                   ing.

                   If both _c_o_m_1 and _c_o_m_2 are omitted, the regis-
                   tration of key binding for the key _c is
                   deleted.

                   statement and so on.  If _n is specified, it
                   breaks _n levels from the loop.

     bbrroowwssee [--@@ _f_i_l_e]

                   Execute _c_o_m the command, and invoke the
                   archive browser who receives its output.  You
                   should the macro representation quoted with ""
                   as _c_o_m.  --ff, --tt, --bb, --ii and --ee options are the
                   same as the one for llaauunncchh the builtin com-
                   mand.  In case that multiple _c_o_ms are
                   specified, the next _c_o_m the command is exe-
                   cuted one after another when you select each
                   files in the archive browser, and the formats
                   and patterns described after each _c_o_m the com-
                   mand are adopted.  In order to return to the
                   previous level of archive browser, you should
                   select the file named as .... or push the key
                   [BBss].  Or you can use QQUUIITT_SSYYSSTTEEMM the command
                   to escape from all of the archive browsers
                   invoked by bbrroowwssee.  You must describe --ff
                   option, except for the last _c_o_m the command.
                   When the last _c_o_m has no --ff option, the com-
                   mand has been just executed instead of invok-
                   ing an archive browser, and then will return
                   to the previous archive browser when it is
                   done.

                   When you specify --pp option, the execution of
                   _c_o_m_2 the command precedes the execution of the
                   next _c_o_m the command when you select a file.
                   While _c_o_m is executed in the sub shell for a
                   pipeline, _c_o_m_2 is executed in the current
                   shell to inherit the values of internal vari-
                   ables set in this command after _c_o_m_2 has been
                   done.  The filenames which is selected toward
                   this level of archive browser are held in
                   positional parameters sequentially, and the
                   last selected filename is held in $$11.  These
                   parameters will be newly set whenever you
                   select a file, so that they are reset in
                   sequential order when you select the next file
                   even if you replace them with sseett or sshhiifftt the
                   builtin command.  --dd and --nn options specify a
                   control if the selected file is a directory or
                   not respectively.  When you specify nnoopprreepp,
                   _c_o_m_2 specified by --pp option is not executed.
                   When you specify lloooopp, you don't step the next
                   _c_o_m the command but the same _c_o_m the command
                   again.

                   And when you think troublesome to describe too
                   many arguments for bbrroowwssee, you can specify
                   _f_i_l_e the file in which some arguments are
                   described with --@@ option.  You can describe --@@
                   option in any place of arguments, the argu-
                   ments described in _f_i_l_e are inserted in the
                   place where --@@ is described.  If you specify --
                   as _f_i_l_e, arguments are read from the standard
                   input instead of the file.  You should
                   describe arguments in _f_i_l_e with spaces or new-
                   lines as separator.  The null line and the
                   line started with ## will be ignored.  When you
                   describe --@@ option in _f_i_l_e, the argument file
                   is referred recursively.

     bbuuiillttiinn _a_r_g ...
                   Execute _a_r_g as a simple builtin command.  When
                   the same named function is defined, the func-
                   tion will not be executed.

     cchhddiirr [--LLPP] [_d_i_r]
                   Change the current directory in ffdd to _d_i_r.  If
                   _d_i_r is omitted, it moves to the directory
                   indicated by HHOOMMEE the internal variable.  If
                   you specify the pathname as "..", "??", "--",
                   "@@", it behaves like as LLOOGG_DDIIRR.

                   If --LL is specified, the logical pathname fol-
                   lowing symbolic links is used.  If --PP is
                   specified, the physical pathname following no
                   symbolic links is used.  Otherwise, the pphhyyssii--
                   ccaall option for sseett the builtin command is
                   effective.

     cchheecckkiidd [_f_i_l_e ...]
                   Calculate the unique ID of the specified file
                   and display it, according to the MD5 algorithm
                   in RFC1321.  When you specify multiple _f_i_l_es,
                   the IDs of all specified files are calculated
                   and displayed.  When you specify nothing, the
                   ID of running ffdd itself is displayed.

                   Since this algorithm is guaranteed to be
                   secure, it is available to confirm the iden-
                   tity of files.

     ccoommmmaanndd [--pp | --vv | --VV] _a_r_g ...
                   Execute _a_r_g as a simple command.  When the
                   same named function is defined, the function
                   will not be executed.  If --pp is specified, the
                   default value of PPAATTHH is used to search the
                   path.  If --vv is specified, the absolute path
                   for _a_r_g is displayed instead of executing _a_r_g.
                   In this case, _a_r_g the builtin command will
                   cause simply its name.  If --VV is specified,
                   verbose description for _a_r_g is displayed as
                   same as ttyyppee.

                   the loop _n - 1 levels out of the loop.

                   Copy the file indicated by _s_r_c into the file
                   or the directory indicated by _d_e_s_t.  When _d_e_s_t
                   indicates a directory, the filename in the
                   destination is _s_r_c.  If _d_e_s_t is omitted, it is
                   copied into the current directory.  You can
                   specify multiple source files by describing to
                   separate them with ++, or by using the wild-
                   card.  When you separate them with ++, those
                   files are concatenated and copied.  When you
                   use the wildcard, they are copied one by one
                   in case that the destination is a directory,
                   and they are concatenated in case that the
                   destination is a file.

                   When you specify --AA, it is treated as the
                   ASCII text file.  When you specify --BB, it is
                   treated as the binary file.  When you specify
                   --VV, it is verified to copy.  When you specify
                   --YY, it doesn't prompts for confirming to
                   overwrite into the destination.  When you
                   specify ----YY, it prompts for confirmation
                   before overwriting into the destination.

                   don't specify --nn, newline is added to output
                   trailing after _a_r_g.  When you specify --NN, the
                   outputted newline becomes CR-NL (\r\n).  See

                   Evaluate parameter macros included in _a_r_g and
                   execute the results.  Since eevvaall doesn't
                   evaluate any parameter macro, you should
                   choose them according to uses.  When in the
                   function, you cannot use any parameter macro,
                   then you need this command to extract parame-
                   ter macros.

                   When you want to define the value at the same
                   time, you should specify _v_a_l_u_e.

                   If only == is specified and _v_a_l_u_e is omitted,
                   the value of _N_A_M_E the environment variable is
                   defined as a null.  If no argument is speci-
                   fied, all of the eexxppoorrtted environment vari-

                   List or edit command histories.  _F_i_r_s_t and
                   _l_a_s_t select the range of command histories.
                   This specification can be described as a
                   numeric value or a string.  A positive value
                   means the command history number, and a nega-
                   tive value means the command history which has
                   the history number as the current history
                   number minus the value.  A string mean the
                   command history which starts with the string.
                   If --nn is specified, command histories are
                   listed without their history numbers.  If --rr
                   is specified, command histories are listed in
                   reverse order.  If --ee is specified, the editor
                   named by _e_d_i_t_o_r is used to edit command his-
                   tories, otherwise the editor specified by
                   FFCCEEDDIITT or EEDDIITTOORR the internal variable is
                   used.

                   When --ll is specified, selected command his-
                   tories are listed to the standard output.  In
                   this case, omitting _l_a_s_t means to specify the
                   current history number, and also omitting
                   _f_i_r_s_t means to specify --1166.

                   When --ss is specified, the command history
                   selected by _f_i_r_s_t is executed immediately.  In
                   this case, omitting _f_i_r_s_t means to specify the
                   current history number.  The first occurrence
                   of the string _o_l_d in the command history will
                   be replaced by the string _n_e_w before execu-
                   tion.

                   When neither --ll nor --ss is not specified,
                   selected command histories are edited, and
                   then each edited commands are executed one by
                   one with display in the standard output.  In
                   this case, omitting _l_a_s_t means to specify
                   _f_i_r_s_t, and also omitting _f_i_r_s_t means to

                   specify _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y, the current directory is
                   moved to the directory initially.  If you
                   specify _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_2, the split window mode
                   is invoked, and the current directory of
                   the supplemental window is moved to the
                   directory.  You can return to the internal

                   sion, such as %%%%, for the reason of the param-

     ggeettkkeeyy [_n_u_m]  Get the key code sequence for the pushed key.
                   It prompts after executed, and displays the
                   key code sequence for the key which you push
                   to specify.  It continues until you push any
                   key _n_u_m times.  When _n_u_m is more than 11 time,
                   you can stop it with pushing [SSppaaccee].  When
                   _n_u_m is 00 time, it continues forever until
                   [SSppaaccee] is pushed.  The displayed sequence can
                   be used as the key code sequence for kkeeyymmaapp
                   command.  ((UUNNIIXX))

     ggeettooppttss _o_p_t_s_t_r _N_A_M_E [_a_r_g ...]
                   Used to parse the optional parameters from a
                   sequence of _a_r_g.  The valid characters as
                   option is described in _o_p_t_s_t_r.  An option
                   character which needs an argument is described
                   with following :: in _o_p_t_s_t_r.  Each time ggeettooppttss
                   is invoked, the new option character parsed
                   from _a_r_g is substituted for _N_A_M_E the internal
                   variable.  When the option has an argument,
                   the argument is substituted for OOPPTTAARRGG the
                   internal variable.  And the index of the next
                   parameter is substituted for OOPPTTIINNDD the inter-
                   nal variable every time.  The value of OOPPTTIINNDD
                   is initialized to 11 whenever the shell is
                   invoked, another parsing of option parameters
                   needs initializing OOPPTTIINNDD to 11 manually.  If
                   _a_r_g is omitted, positional parameters are
                   parsed to the optional parameters.

                   When the end of option is encountered, ggeettooppttss
                   will exit with the value of 11.  In this case,
                   ?? is substituted for _N_A_M_E.  When an option
                   character which is not included in _o_p_t_s_t_r is
                   found, an error message is written to the
                   standard error, then ?? is substituted for _N_A_M_E
                   and OOPPTTAARRGG is unset.  But, if OOPPTTAARRGG is
                   started with ::, no error message is written,
                   and the found option character is substituted
                   for OOPPTTAARRGG instead.  When no argument is found
                   with the option character which needs an argu-
                   ment, an error message is written to the stan-
                   dard error, then ?? is substituted for _N_A_M_E and
                   OOPPTTAARRGG is unset.  But, if OOPPTTAARRGG is started
                   with ::, no error message is written, then the
                   found option character is substituted for
                   OOPPTTAARRGG instead, and :: is substituted for _N_A_M_E.

     hhaasshh [--rr | _c_o_m ...]

                   PPAATTHH, which indicates the search path when the
                   external command is executed, and register the
                   result in the hash table.

                   When you specify --rr instead of _c_o_m, all the
                   memorized hash table is discarded.  If _c_o_m is
                   omitted, the hash table information is listed.

                   ure of the work required to search it in the
                   search path, and the absolute path for the
                   command, respectively.  When the command is
                   searched in a relative directory, it is neces-
                   sary to re-search whenever the current direc-

                   and describe the format of the list as _f_o_r_m_a_t.
                   When you describe _t_o_p and _b_o_t_t_o_m, you can
                   specify unnecessary lines in the list as the
                   number of lines from the top/bottom line.
                   When _e_x_t starts with //, uppercase/lowercase is
                   ignored in the comparison of any extension.

                   If _c_o_m is omitted, the launcher registration
                   for _e_x_t is canceled.

                   When you register an archive browser, you can
                   use the latter form to describe more detailed
                   control.  You can specify multiple formats as
                   candidates with multiple --ff options.  These
                   candidates for format are compared in order of
                   appearance, if no one is matched completely
                   then the nearest one is adopted.  --ii and --ee
                   options specify _p_a_t_t the pattern for the line
                   to be ignored and for the line to be treated
                   as error respectively.  When the list includes
                   unnecessary lines you can specify also _t_o_p and
                   _b_o_t_t_o_m, but you must specify lines except
                   top/bottom lines with --ii option.  In case that
                   a failure to unpack files in the archive file
                   causes outputting some strings, you can
                   specify the strings with --ee option.  --ii and --ee
                   options can specify multiple patterns, and
                   they are effective if one of them is matched.
                   And you can use a wildcard in the description
                   for each _p_a_t_t the pattern.

     pprriinnttddrrvv [_c]  Print the device file and the number of
                   heads/sectors/cylinders of the floppy drive
                   registered for the drive name _c.  ((UUNNIIXX))

                   If _c is omitted, all of the registered floppy
                   drives is listed.

     pprriinnttllaauunncchh [_e_x_t]
                   Print the command macro registered as the
                   launcher for _e_x_t the extension.  When it is
                   registered as the archive browser, the format
                   for listing is also printed.

                   If _e_x_t is omitted, all of the registered
                   launchers is listed.

     pprriinnttrroommaann [_r_o_m_a_n]
                   Print the Roman-Kana translation table for the
                   Kana-Kanji IME mode.  It means printing the
                   Japanese string bound for _r_o_m_a_n the Roman
                   string.  ((UUNNIIXX))

                   If _r_o_m_a_n is omitted, all the registered Roman-
                   Kana translation table is listed.

     ppuusshhdd [_d_i_r]   Load the current directory onto the directory
                   stack, and change the current directory in ffdd
                   to _d_i_r.  If you specify the pathname as "..",
                   "??", "--", "@@", it behaves like as LLOOGG_DDIIRR.
                   The pphhyyssiiccaall option for sseett the builtin com-
                   mand is effective for symbolic links.

                   If _d_i_r is omitted, change the current direc-
                   tory to the top directory of the directory
                   stack, and replace it with the current direc-
                   tory.  In this case, this command is failed
                   when the directory stack is empty.

     ppwwdd [--LLPP]     Display the current directory with the abso-
                   lute representation.  If --LL is specified, the
                   logical pathname following symbolic links is
                   displayed.  If --PP is specified, the physical
                   pathname following no symbolic links is
                   displayed.  Otherwise, the pphhyyssiiccaall option for
                   sseett the builtin command is effective.

     rreeaadd [--NN] [_N_A_M_E ...]
                   Read one line from the standard input and sub-
                   stitute that string for _N_A_M_E the internal
                   variable.  The inputted string is separated
                   with IIFFSS into some words.  When multiple _N_A_M_Es
                   are specified, words are substituted one by
                   one from the first of line, and all the rest
                   are substituted for the last _N_A_M_E.  When the
                   number of words in inputted string is less
                   than the number of _N_A_M_E, a null is substituted
                   for the rest of _N_A_M_E.

                   If --NN is specified, the newline of the line to
                   be read is regarded as CR-NL (\r\n).

     rreeaaddlliinnee [_p_r_o_m_p_t]
                   Read one line from the terminal input and out-
                   put that string to the standard output.  When
                   _p_r_o_m_p_t is specified, the string is displayed
                   on the beginning of input line.  This command
                   differs from rreeaadd the builtin command in the
                   terminal input and the line editing.  You can-
                   not use the history as one of the line edit-
                   ing, but can use the completion for a path-
                   name.

     rreeaaddoonnllyy [_N_A_M_E[==[_v_a_l_u_e]] ...]
                   Mark _N_A_M_E the internal variable to be
                   readonly.  Since then, you cannot change the
                   value of _N_A_M_E.  When you want to define the
                   value at the same time, you should specify
                   _v_a_l_u_e.

                   If only == is specified and _v_a_l_u_e is omitted,
                   the value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable is
                   defined as a null.  If no argument is
                   specified, all of the readonly internal vari-
                   ables is listed.

     rrdd _d_i_r        Delete the directory _d_i_r.  You cannot delete
                   the non-empty directory.

     rrmmddiirr _d_i_r     Same as rrdd.  ((DDOOSS))

     rreenn _o_l_d _n_e_w
     rreennaammee _o_l_d _n_e_w
                   Rename the filename or the directory name _o_l_d
                   into _n_e_w.  You can specify the wildcard in _o_l_d
                   and _n_e_w to rename the multiple filenames all
                   together.

     rreemm [_a_r_g ...] No effect, same as ::.

     rreettuurrnn [_n]    Return from a function with the return value
                   specified by _n.  If _n is omitted, the return
                   value is the exit status of the last executed
                   command.  It cannot be used out of a function.

     ssaavveettttyy [--nn]  Save the current terminal settings.  The saved
                   settings will be restored when EEXXEECCUUTTEE__SSHH is
                   executed later.  In case that you change termi-
                   nal settings with ssttttyy(1) and so on, you
                   should save the settings with this command not
                   to reset settings with the next execution of
                   EEXXEECCUUTTEE__SSHH.  If you change terminal settings
                   and execute this command not in the same com-
                   mand line, you should notice that this command
                   will save the reset settings.  If --nn is speci-
                   fied, the saved settings will be cleared.

     sseett [----aabbCCeeffhhkkmmnnttuuvvxx] [--oo _o_p_t_i_o_n] [_a_r_g ...]
                   List internal variables and functions, without
                   any argument.  When you specify _a_r_g, _a_r_g is
                   substituted for the positional parameter $$11,
                   $$22, ..., $$_n in order.  When you specify any
                   option, each option means the following.  When
                   you use ++ instead of --, the option parameter
                   turns off each option.
                   --aa   EExxppoorrtt any internal variable automati-

                   --ff   Disable the wildcard expansion.
                   --hh   Register any command to the hash table
                        just before it is executed.  The commands
                        used in a function are read when it is
                        defined, and are registered to the hash
                        table.  The command hash itself is always

                   machine or PC-9800 series.  In this case, You
                   should describe the device file as the device
                   name prepared per the physical drive unit
                   rather than the device name prepared per the
                   partition (slice).  The MS-DOS partitions
                   included in the drive unit are automatically
                   expanded to the drive name after the drive
                   name _c.  When no MS-DOS partition is included
                   in the specified drive unit, this command is
                   ignored.  You can confirm what drive name is
                   valid by pprriinnttddrrvv command.  But any hard disk
                   is registered as readonly, for security.

     Since representing the whole file system in tree structure
     takes too many time, only the directories which are direct
     ancestors and the direct sub directories are displayed,
     first in the tree screen.  In the directories which are
     direct ancestors, the other sub directories (if exists) are
     grouped as "......".  These grouped sub directories will be
     expanded automatically when a cursor is placed on its posi-
     tion.

     The sub directories which are not expanded yet are
     represented with '>>' trailing the filename, which shows as
     they are.  Such directory is never expanded until it is
     required to expand explicitly, then you should expand it by
     the following key inputs before moving to any hidden sub
     directory.

     In the tree screen, the following key inputs are available.

          LLeefftt      Group sub directories of the directory on the
                    cursor position, or move a cursor to the
                    parent directory.
          ((, ))      Move a cursor to the previous/next directory
                    among the same level sub directories.

     When directories are recursively expanded, the machine
     operation is so late that it maybe seems to freeze.  In this
     case, you can input any key while operating.  If key input
     is recognized while expanding directories, expanding has
     been stopped at that moment in spite of not finishing.  Even
     if key repeat keeps effective, any operation will be delayed
     for this function.

     When you want to register a new archive browser, you must
     describe the format listed by the archiver as the following
     representation.  One format string represents the format for
     1 file in the list.
          %%aa        Field which indicates a file mode
          %%uu        Field which indicates UID of a file
          %%gg        Field which indicates GID of a file
          %%ss        Field which indicates a file size
          %%yy        Field which indicates a file creation year
          %%mm        Field which indicates a file creation month
                    (No concerning if numeric or alphabetical)
          %%dd        Field which indicates a file creation day
          %%ww        Field which indicates a file creation week (ignored)
          %%tt        Field which indicates a file creation time
                    ("HH:MM:SS" form, MM and SS can be lacking)
          %%pp        Field which indicates a file creation am/pm
          %%BB        Field which indicates a major device ID
          %%bb        Field which indicates a minor device ID
          %%//_s_t_r//    Field which indicates a type is directory
                    when this field string is _s_t_r
                    (case insensitive)
          %%!!_s_t_r!!    0 or more continuous fields
                    which consists of the string _s_t_r
                    (case insensitive)
          %%ff        Field which indicates a filename
          %%xx        Field which is needless (ignored)
          %%%%        % itself
          \\nn        Newline
          SSppaaccee TTaabb 0 or more characters of spaces or tabs

     In this description, the field means the area separated by
     spaces, tabs or newlines.  When the string which indicates
     each information is separated by these characters, you can
     simply describe the above string which indicates that field.
     When the string is separated by another character, you
     should describe the above string with that separator.  You
     can describe to indicate the field length as numeric, such
     as %_1_0_a.  This example means that the field which indicates
     a file mode consists of 10 characters.  If you describe it
     with a character ** as the field length instead of numeric,
     such as %*_f, the string to the end of line is regarded as a
     field, in which any space and tab will be ignored.

     When a field may have the different meanings according to
     situation, you should describe it quoted with {{ }}, such as
     %{_y_t}.  This example means that this field indicates a crea-
     tion year or a creation time.  When the information for 1
     file consists of multiple lines, you should place a \\nn on
     the position of newline in the format string.

     For example, the following are the format strings for the
     list of some archivers.  While some spaces are used here for
     easiness to see, these spaces are not always necessary
     because any space between fields is ignored.
     `llhhaa ll'           "%9a %u/%g %s %x %m %d %{yt} %f"
     `llhhaa vv' (MS-DOS)  "%f\n%s %x %x %y-%m-%d %t"
     `ttaarr ttvvff' (BSD)   "%9a %u/%g %s %m %d %t %y %f"
     `ttaarr ttvvff' (SVR4)  "%a %u/%g %s %m %d %t %y %f"

     If you register archive browsers with above format, in the
     builtin command of EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH or in the initial configura-
     tion file, you can use the archive browser which is not
     prepared by default.  But, if you want to execute or view
     files in the archive file, you must register the archiver
     command for the archive file, too, don't forget this.

     On some OS, ttaarr(1) may output the Japanese timestamp when
     _j_a_p_a_n_e_s_e is substituted for LLAANNGG the environment variable.
     Since ffdd cannot analyze the representation like this, you
     should describe `_e_x_p_o_r_t _L_A_N_G=_C' in the initial configuration
     file, or specify LLAANNGG in the description of listing command,
     such as `_L_A_N_G=_C _t_a_r _t_v_f'.

     FFllooppppyy DDrriivvee ((UUNNIIXX))
     You can access the MS-DOS formatted floppy disk, by
     representing to prefix "_c::" to the directory name.  But, it
     is necessary to register the floppy drive and set DDOOSSDDRRIIVVEE
     the internal variable which makes this function effective,
     in advance.

     Each registered drive is distinguished with the drive name.
     You should tag the physically different drive as the dif-
     ferent drive name.  When the same physical drive supports
     multiple formats, you can register each format with the same
     drive name, or the different drive name each other.  If you
     tag the same drive name, the justice of the format is tried
     in registered order, so that you should register the format
     which you often use in the first place.

     Each drive of the floppy drive has the its own current
     directory.  The default value of this is a root directory,
     and the current directory is moved back to a root directory
     again whenever you change a floppy disk.  When you describe
     the directory name as starting with '/' after '::', it means
     the absolute path representation of that drive.  If this '/'
     is not exist, it means the relative path representation from
     the current directory of that drive, don't forget this.

     Regrettably, some internal commands like as WWRRIITTEE_DDIIRR,
     IINNFFOO_FFIILLEESSYYSS cannot support the floppy drive.  Some
     filenames are renamed when they are copied from UNIX for
     reason of the filename length limit.

     When you use a lowercase letter as the drive name, you can
     access it as the floppy drive which can treat the Long File
     Name (LFN) for MS-Windows formatted floppy disk.  In this
     case, you can copy a file with a long filename on UNIX as it
     is.  But, when the UNICODE translation table ffdd--uunniiccdd..ttbbll
     does not exist in the same directory as the invoked ffdd ex-
     ists, any Kanji filename cannot be treated as LFN representa-
     tion.  Reversely, when you use a uppercase letter as the
     drive name, LFN is ignored and 8+3 formed filename is treat-
     ed.  MS-DOS version inherits this specification by the case
     of a drive name.

     UURRLL DDrriivvee ((UUNNIIXX))
     You can access remote services on the network, by represent-
     ing the URL string as the directory name.  The URL format is
     _s_c_h_e_m_e::////[_u_s_e_r[::_p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d]@@]_h_o_s_t[::_p_o_r_t]//_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y//.  You can
     specify ffttpp or hhttttpp as _s_c_h_e_m_e.  You can specify the name or
     IP address of the remote host as _h_o_s_t.  You can specify the
     TCP port number as _p_o_r_t.  If _p_o_r_t is omitted, the default
     port number is used.  The default port number for ffttpp is 2211,
     and the default port number for hhttttpp is 8800.  You can specify
     account informations to connect the remote host as _u_s_e_r and
     _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d.  If _u_s_e_r is omitted, the anonymous FTP connection
     will be used with ffttpp, or you will be queried as needed with
     hhttttpp.  If _p_a_s_s_w_o_r_d is omitted, you will be queried as needed.
     But, it is necessary to set UURRLLDDRRIIVVEE the internal variable
     which makes this function effective, in advance.

     Regrettably, some internal commands cannot support the URL
     drive, for the sake of restrictions of the FTP and HTTP pro-
     tocols or settings of the host side.

     SSttrriinngg IInnppuutt
     When you input the string, such as the pathname, the follow-
     ing key inputs are available.  The kind of referred history
     differs with the input string required.  In the split window
     mode, the current directory of another window is always
     placed on the top of the pathname history.
     LLeefftt, RRiigghhtt
               Move a cursor.
     UUpp, DDoowwnn  Refer the previous histories (only commands and
               pathnames), or move a cursor.
     BBeegg       Move a cursor to the beginning of string.
     EEooll       Move a cursor to the end of string.
     IInnss       Switch a input method to the insert/overwrite
               mode.  (Default value is the insert mode.)
     DDeell       Delete a character on the cursor position.
     BBss        Delete a character before the cursor position.
     DDeellLLiinnee   Delete a string after the cursor position.
     IInnssLLiinnee   Treat the next input character as it is, effective
               to input control characters.
     EEnntteerr     Insert a filename of the file on the cursor posi-
               tion.
     PPaaggeeUUpp    Convert a character on the cursor position to
               uppercase.
     PPaaggeeDDoowwnn  Convert a character on the cursor position to
               lowercase.
     TTaabb       Complete a pathname, a command name or a variable
               name on the cursor position.
               When there are two or more completion choices,
               inputting this continuously can display the com-
               pletion choice list.  Except for command line in
               the internal shell, you can make a choice from
               this list with cursor keys and [RReettuurrnn].
     ^^LL        Redraw the input string.
     ^^SS, ^^RR    Search the previous histories (only commands and
               pathnames) incrementally.
     RReettuurrnn    Decide the input, or decide the choice in the com-
               pletion choice list.
     EEsscc       Cancel.

     The inputted string is expanded before evaluation as follow-
     ing.  These expansions are also valid in the string of com-
     mand macros.  But these expansions are restrained in the
     string quoted with the quotation mark ''.

     ~~       Indicate your home directory, when it is the begin-
             ning of filename.

     ~~_u_s_e_r   Indicate _u_s_e_r's home directory, when it is the
             beginning of filename.  ((UUNNIIXX))

     ~~FFDD     Indicate the directory where the invoked ffdd is
             exists, when it is the beginning of filename.

     $$_N_A_M_E
     $${{_N_A_M_E}} Indicate the value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable or
             the environment variable.  When both are defined,
             the internal variable is prior.  When both are unde-
             fined, it is replaced a null.  The brace {{ }}
             separates _N_A_M_E from its trailing characters.

             When _N_A_M_E is the following character, it is replaced
             by the value substituted automatically by the shell.
             00      The executable filename when invoked.
             [11-99]  The positional parameter.
             **      The all positional parameters which starts
                    from $$11.  ""$$**"" is replaced by ""$$11 $$22 ..."".
             @@      The all positional parameters which starts
                    from $$11.  ""$$@@"" is replaced by ""$$11"" ""$$22"" ... .
             ##      The number of positional parameters.
             --      The option flags which is set by options when
                    invoked or sseett the builtin command.
             ??      The exit status of the last executed command.
             $$      The process number of the current shell.
             !!      The process number of the last executed back-
                    ground process.

     $${{_N_A_M_E::--_w_o_r_d}}
             If the value except a null is substituted for _N_A_M_E
             the internal variable or the environment variable,
             it is replaced by the value, otherwise it is
             replaced by _w_o_r_d.

     $${{_N_A_M_E::==_w_o_r_d}}
             If the value except a null is substituted for _N_A_M_E
             the internal variable or the environment variable,
             it is replaced by the value, otherwise _w_o_r_d is sub-
             stituted for _N_A_M_E the internal variable, and this
             expression itself is replaced by _w_o_r_d.  But you can-
             not substitute the value for any positional parame-
             ter.

     $${{_N_A_M_E::??_w_o_r_d}}
             If the value except a null is substituted for _N_A_M_E
             the internal variable or the environment variable,
             it is replaced by the value, otherwise display _w_o_r_d
             and exit from the shell.  If _w_o_r_d is omitted, the
             string ``ppaarraammeetteerr nnuullll oorr nnoott sseett'' is displayed in
             its place.

     $${{_N_A_M_E::++_w_o_r_d}}
             If the value except a null is substituted for _N_A_M_E
             the internal variable or the environment variable,
             it is replaced by _w_o_r_d, otherwise it is replaced by
             a null.

     $${{_N_A_M_E--_w_o_r_d}}
             If any value is substituted for _N_A_M_E the internal
             variable or the environment variable, it is replaced
             by the value, otherwise it is replaced by _w_o_r_d.

     $${{_N_A_M_E==_w_o_r_d}}
             If any value is substituted for _N_A_M_E the internal
             variable or the environment variable, it is replaced
             by the value, otherwise _w_o_r_d is substituted for _N_A_M_E
             the internal variable, and this expression itself is
             replaces by _w_o_r_d.  But you cannot substitute the
             value for any positional parameter.

     $${{_N_A_M_E??_w_o_r_d}}
             If any value is substituted for _N_A_M_E the internal
             variable or the environment variable, it is replaced
             by the value, otherwise display _w_o_r_d and exit from
             the shell.  If _w_o_r_d is omitted, the string ``ppaarraammee--
             tteerr nnuullll oorr nnoott sseett'' is displayed in its place.

     $${{_N_A_M_E++_w_o_r_d}}
             If any value is substituted for _N_A_M_E the internal
             variable or the environment variable, it is replaced
             by _w_o_r_d, otherwise it is replaced by a null.

     $${{##_N_A_M_E}}
             It is replaced by the length in characters of the
             value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable or the environ-
             ment variable.  If _N_A_M_E is ** or @@, it is replaced by
             the number of positional parameters instead of the
             length of characters.

     $${{_N_A_M_E%%_w_o_r_d}}
             It is replaced by the string in which the smallest
             portion of the suffix matched by the _w_o_r_d pattern is
             deleted from the value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable
             or the environment variable.  If _N_A_M_E is ** or @@,
             each positional parameter is replaced.  ( \\ is used
             instead of %% on MS-DOS version.)

     $${{_N_A_M_E%%%%_w_o_r_d}}
             It is replaced by the string in which the largest
             portion of the suffix matched by the _w_o_r_d pattern is
             deleted from the value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable
             or the environment variable.  If _N_A_M_E is ** or @@,
             each positional parameter is replaced.  ( \\\\ is used
             instead of %%%% on MS-DOS version.)

     $${{_N_A_M_E##_w_o_r_d}}
             It is replaced by the string in which the smallest
             portion of the prefix matched by the _w_o_r_d pattern is
             deleted from the value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable
             or the environment variable.  If _N_A_M_E is ** or @@,
             each positional parameter is replaced.

     $${{_N_A_M_E####_w_o_r_d}}
             It is replaced by the string in which the largest
             portion of the prefix matched by the _w_o_r_d pattern is
             deleted from the value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable
             or the environment variable.  If _N_A_M_E is ** or @@,
             each positional parameter is replaced.

     \\_c      It indicates a character _c itself.  You can use it
             when you want to use the preceding meta-character as
             a character with no evaluation, such as ~~ or $$.  You
             can describe \\ itself as "\\\\".  But, on MS-DOS ver-
             sion, because \\ which is used as the pathname delim-
             iter must be treat as well as the normal character,
             %%_c is expediently used in place of \\.

     The following is replaced only in the shell which is exe-
     cuted by EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH and EEXXEECCUUTTEE_FFIILLEE.

     ``_l_i_s_t``  _L_i_s_t is executed and this string is replaced by its
             standard output.

     $$((_l_i_s_t)) _L_i_s_t is executed and this string is replaced by its
             standard output like as ``_l_i_s_t``.  This differs from
             ``_l_i_s_t`` in the point that nested expressions are
             allowed.  And any meta-characters such as quotes in
             _l_i_s_t are evaluated as it is.

     $$((((_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n))))
             _E_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n the arithmetic expression is evaluated
             and this string is replaced by its result value.
             You can specify numeric values, variables and
             integral calculations with the following operators
             in _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.

     ??
     **
     [[
     ]]       The string including these letters is pattern-
             matched with existent files.  When it is matched, it
             is replaced by all of the matched filenames which
             are sorted in alphabetical order.
             ??    Match any single character except //.
             **    Match any 0 or more length string not including
                  //.
             ****   Match any 0 or more length string including //.
             [[...]]
                  Match any one of the characters enclosed by [[
                  ]].  When enclosed characters include --, it
                  matches any character whose character code is
                  between characters before/after --.
             [[!!...]]
                  Match any one of the characters not enclosed by
                  [[ ]].

             But, when the first character of the filename is ..,
             ??, ** and **** don't match it.

     EEddiitt MMooddee
     When you want to use some functions bound to special keys,
     such as a cursor key or a scroll key, such a key doesn't
     exist in some terminals.  In such a case, substituting the
     string for EEDDIITTMMOODDEE the internal variable can make you use
     some control keys as alternative to these special keys.
     Since this alternative key function is prior to the key
     binding by the builtin command, the key binding is invalid
     for the control characters used as the alternative keys.
     The prepared edit modes are the following 3 modes.

             "command mode", and the function of keys are quite
             different with each mode.  You are in the command
             mode when you start to input, then you must input
             any key among 4 keys which switch to the insert
             mode, in order to input normal keys.

             This key binding is so particular that it is not
             suitable for those who don't use vvii editor everyday.

     KKaannaa--KKaannjjii IIMMEE ((UUNNIIXX))
     You can input strings in the Kana-Kanji IME mode, if you in-
     put the key specified by IIMMEEKKEEYY or select "Kanji" from the
     pseudo terminal menu.

     The translation performance will depend on the Kana-Kanji
     translation dictionary ffdd-iddiicctt..ttbbll.  When it does not exist
     in the same directory as the invoked ffdd exists, translation
     to Kanji will not be available.  The standard installed dic-
     tionary file is the Tan-Kanji dictionary, which can support
     only the Tan-Kanji translation.  The dictionaly such as the
     pubdic, which includes the Hinsi information, will bring you
     the Tan-Bunsetsu translation.  The Ren-Bunsetsu translation
     is not be supported.

     In the Kana-Kanji IME mode, the following key inputs are
     available.
          SSppaaccee     Trancelate to Kanji, or select the next trans-
                    lation candidate.
          LLeefftt, RRiigghhtt
          UUpp, DDoowwnn  Move a cursor in the list of the translation
                    candidate.
          BBss, DDeell   Delete a character before the cursor position.
          TTaabb       Toggle Hiragana, Katakana, Hankaku-Kana and
                    the direct input.
          ^^LL        Redraw the input string.
          RReettuurrnn    Decide the translation result.
          EEsscc       Cancel.

     When you translate the string of the capital 4 digit hexa-
     decimal prefixed by a capital letter, it is regarded as the
     hexadecimal showing the following Kanji code respectively.
     Then the menu will be displayed to select Kanji next to the
     Kanji code number.
          SS   Shift JIS
          EE   EUC-JP
          JJ   JIS code (JIS X0208)
          KK   Kuten code
          UU   UNICODE (UCS2)
     When you input [SSppaaccee] in the state where you decide an un-
     translated Kana, it is regarded as the initial reading of
     Kanji.  Then the menu will be desplayed to select Kanji
     whose reading starts with the Kana.

     PPaarraammeetteerr MMaaccrrooss
     You can use the following parameter macros in the string
     which is used for the registration of command macros and for
     executing command.  But, you cannot use them in the func-
     tions, the input file for ssoouurrccee command, and the initial
     configuration file, then you should use eevvaallmmaaccrroo command
     when you want to use any parameter macro in them.

     %%CC      The filename on the cursor position.  Or, it indi-
             cates the archive filename, in the macro to register
             the archiver command.

     %%XX      The filename except its extension on the cursor
             position.  Or, it indicates the archive filename
             except its extension, in the macro to register the
             archiver command.  Only the last one extension is
             removed.  TT, TTAA, MM trailing %%XX are replaced by %%TT,
             %%TTAA, %%MM except its extension respectively.  On MS-
             DOS version, you can describe a trailing SS as well
             as them.

     %%PP      The pathname of the current directory.

     %%KK      Prompt and return to ffdd after a command is finished.
             But, the meaning of %%KK is reverse in EEXXEECCUUTTEE_FFIILLEE
             and EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH; it prompts by default and doesn't
             prompt if %%KK is specified.  You can never specify to
             prompt in macros to register the archive browser of
             the launcher and macros to register the archiver
             command.

     %%TT      List marked files separated by spaces as possible.
             When files are so many that the command line exceeds
             11002233 characters, the rest of marked files are
             ignored.

     %%TTAA     List marked files as well as %%TT, and repeat the same
             command for spilt files to complete all marked
             files.

     %%MM      Execute the same command as many times as marked
             files, sending the marked file one by one.  It is
             useful to mark files by MMAARRKK_FFIINNDD and execute "mv %M
             %XM.bak" by EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH.

     %%NN      Restrain the filename addition even if the parameter
             is omitted.

     %%RR      Make you input the additional parameter in executing
             a macro, if the length of command string has enough
             margin.  The cursor position in input is placed on
             the position of %%RR in a macro.  But, %%RR is ignored
             in macros to register the archive browser of the
             launcher, macros to register the archiver command,
             and EEXXEECCUUTTEE_FFIILLEE, EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH.

     %%SS      The 8+3 formed filename with which the LFN formed
             filename on the cursor position is replaced.  You
             can use it when you use external commands which can
             treat only 8+3 formed arguments.  TT, TTAA, MM trailing
             %%SS can be described as well as %%XX.  ((DDOOSS))

             ((UUNNIIXX))

     %%JJAA     The Kanji code of the string enclosed by this macro
             is converted into the Kanji code which is used in
             the pathname indicated by the string.  The variables
             SSJJIISSPPAATTHH, EEUUCCPPAATTHH, etc. can specify what kanji code
             is used in each pathname.  ((UUNNIIXX))

     When no filename parameter, such as %%CC and %%TT, is taken with
     the result to expand parameter macros in a command macro,
     the filename on the cursor position is automatically added
     to the last of expanded string, as ./_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e form.  This
     addition is not done, in case of the input string for exe-
     cuting command, or when %%NN macro is specified.

                  Any valid variable name as the internal vari-
                  able can be valid to be defined as the environ-
                  ment variable in advance.  But the internal
                  variable is always prior to the environment
                  variable in ffdd.  When the same named environ-
                  ment variable is used in another application,
                  you can also use the name which FFDD_ is prefixed
                  to each environment variable for ffdd only.  This
                  environment variable with FFDD_ is always prior
                  to the environment variable without it, then
                  the definition of the environment variable with
                  FFDD_ is prior to the definition of the internal
                  variable without FFDD_.

     the right/left cursor key, and select the item with the
     up/down cursor key, and change its content with [RReettuurrnn].
     When you finish to change, exit from the customizer with

                  screen.
        KKeeyy bbiinndd  Change the command bound to each key.  When you

                  deleted.  ((UUNNIIXX))
        LLaauunncchheerr  Change the launcher registration for each
                  extension.  When you newly register a launcher
                  for the extension with no registration, you
                  should select "NewEntry".  If you input a null
                  line when you input a command for the launcher,
                  the existent launcher registration is deleted.
        AArrcchhiivveerr  Change the archiver command registration for
                  each extension.  When you newly register a
                  archiver command for the extension with no
                  registration, you should select "NewEntry".  If
                  you input a null line both when you input a
                  command for pack/unpack, the existent archiver
                  command registration is deleted.
        DDOOSS ddrriivvee Change the floppy drive registration.  When you
                  newly register a floppy drive for the drive
                  name with no registration, you should select
                  "NewEntry".  If you input a null line when you
                  input a device name, the existent floppy drive
                  registration is deleted.  ((UUNNIIXX))

                            specified file.
                  Overwrite Overwrite all the configurations
                            within the specified categories to
                            the specified existent file.  The
                            original configurations which has
                            existed in the file are parsed, and
                            the configuration for the same target
                            is overwritten at the same place as
                            possible.  The configurations which
                            are not set up at present and the
                            configurations which are not sup-

                            as it is.

                  When you specify the range of categories, all
                  categories are selected by default, then you
                  should turn on/off each selection with [SSppaaccee]
                  and decide with [RReettuurrnn].

     If you try to exit from the customizer without saving after
     changing any configuration, you will be confirmed whether if
     it is right to exit without saving.  While the changed con-
     figurations themselves are valid even if you exit without
     saving, when you want them to be valid in the next invoked
     ffdd, you must save them into the initial configuration file.

     The following environment variables are valid in ffdd.  These
     environment variables can be valid if they are defined as
     the internal variables.  You can specify them as the command
     line options in `--_N_A_M_E==_v_a_l_u_e' form.  But the variables
     followed by * cannot be use with the prefix FFDD_ as the
     environment variables.

     AADDJJTTTTYY        Reset the terminal mode forcedly to the normal
                   state, when ffdd is finished.  Invoking ffdd can
                   adjust the terminal rightly from the state
                   displaying broken characters.  Any value
                   except 00 and null effects valid.  ((UUNNIIXX))

     AANNSSIICCOOLLOORR     Colorize the file display.  When the terminal
                   which you use supports the color control
                   escape sequence of ANSI standard, each file is
                   displayed with color according to its file
                   type.  If the value is 11, it is colorized.  If
                   the value is 22, the background color is forced
                   to be black, for the case that the foreground
                   color is the same as the background color and
                   indistinguishable.  If the value is 33, the
                   foreground color is forced to be black.

     AANNSSIIPPAALLEETTTTEE   Specify color palette according to file type
                   when the file display is colorized.  This
                   variable value consists of a numeric value
                   whose maximum columns are 1111 columns.  The
                   number of each column shows a color number,
                   which specifies the color of file type
                   corresponding with its column.  The following
                   are correspondence of the column number to the
                   file type.
                       11    normal file
                       22    background
                       33    directory
                       44    unwritable file
                       55    unreadable file
                       66    symbolic link
                       77    socket (or system file on MS-DOS)
                       88    FIFO (or label on MS-DOS)
                       99    block device
                       1100   character device
                       1111   executable file

                   The following are the meaning of color number
                   specified on each column.
                       00    black
                       11    red
                       22    green
                       33    yellow
                       44    blue
                       55    magenta
                       66    cyan
                       77    white
                       88    default color for foreground
                       99    default color for background

                   The color number 88 is forced to be black, if
                   the value of AANNSSIICCOOLLOORR the variable is 33.  The
                   color number 99 is forced to be black, if the
                   value of AANNSSIICCOOLLOORR the variable is 22.

                   When the columns are less than 1111 or this
                   variable is not set, the standard color
                   palette will be applied for the file type
                   corresponding with the following columns.  The
                   standard color palette is described with the
                   above color number as 8899662244335511888888.

     AAUUTTOOUUPPDDAATTEE    Specify the interval in seconds to update auto-
                   matically the browser screen or the tree
                   screen.  When the key input idles for the spec-
                   ified seconds, the current information of file
                   list will be updated.  If this value is 00, the
                   screen will never updated automatically.  The
                   default value is 00.

     BBAASSIICCCCUUSSTTOOMM   Limit the internal variables for configuration
                   only to basic variables in the customizer, to
                   hide advanced variables.  Any value except 00
                   and null effects valid.

     CCDDPPAATTHH*       Specify the search path when an argument of ccdd
                   the builtin command does not start with //.
                   You can specify multiple paths separating with
                   '::'.  No search path is specified by default.

     CCOOLLUUMMNNSS*      The variable for the columns of a terminal
                   screen.  If some value is set, this value will
                   be replaced automatically according to chang-
                   ing the screen size.  If no value is set, this
                   value will remain unset.

     CCOOMMSSPPEECC       Specify the shell used to invoke a batch file.
                   If undefined, the shell defined by SSHHEELLLL the
                   internal variable or \COMMAND.COM is used.

     DDEEFFCCOOLLUUMMNNSS    Specify the columns displayed in the screen
                   when ffdd is invoked.  The default value is 22.
                   If you specify the value except 11, 22, 33 and 55,
                   it is ignored.

     DDEEFFKKCCOODDEE      Specify the system default Kanji code.  The
                   arguments passed to external commands invoked
                   from ffdd will be converted into the specified
                   Kanji code.  When you use macros such as %%CC
                   and %%JJJJ, it will be converted into the Kanji
                   code according to each macro. JJIISS88, JJUUNNEETT,
                   HHEEXX, CCAAPP, etc. among them are the Kanji codes

     DDOOSSDDRRIIVVEE      Validate the access function to the MS-DOS

                   this validation cannot make you access the
                   floppy.  Any value except 00 and null effects
                   valid.

                   On MS-DOS version, This definition can make
                   you treat the LFN formed filename in the old
                   DOS before Ver. 6.xx.  In this case, you don't
                   have to register any floppy drive.  the access
                   speed may be slow or some functions may be
                   restricted for the reason to operate the disk

                   internal shell, the cursor addressing of ter-
                   minal mode is not valid.  In case of some ter-
                   minal such as a console terminal, the cursor
                   addressing cannot work correctly in this ter-
                   minal mode, and the editing string is
                   displayed incorrectly.  When this variable is
                   valid, while no control sequence is used to
                   edit command line, an inefficient cursor
                   addressing will cause restriction of some
                   functions and failure of response.  Any value
                   except 00 and null effects valid.

                   not specified as fullpath, it will be regarded
                   as the path under your home directory.  You
                   must prepare the directory in which the log
                   file is stored, because any directories are

                   the area enough to be specified here cannot be
                   obtained, the informations are reduced in the
                   order of UID, GID, timestamp, size.  The
                   default value is 1122 characters.

     OOPPTTAARRGG*       An option argument is substituted in ggeettooppttss
                   the builtin command.

     OOPPTTIINNDD*       Specify the index of the next parameter in
                   ggeettooppttss the builtin command.

     PPAAGGEERR         Specify the pager command used for viewing

     PPAATTHH*         Specify the search path for executing external
                   commands.  You can specify multiple paths
                   separating with '::'.

     PPPPIIDD*         Indicate the process ID of the parent proccess
                   for ffdd which is invoked first.  ((UUNNIIXX))

     PPRREECCEEDDEEPPAATTHH   Specify the file preceding function, which
                   displays only filenames before obtaining their
                   file informations, for the directory which has
                   a lot of files like as /dev.  You can specify
                   multiple pathnames separating with '::'.  You
                   are enough to specify only the top directory
                   where you want to realize the file preceding
                   function, then the file preceding function is
                   valid in all of the directories under that
                   directory.  When the file preceding function
                   is effective, any files are not sorted in that
                   directory, and file informations are obtained
                   file by file while waiting the key input.  No
                   pathname is specified by default.

     PPRREECCOOPPYYMMEENNUU   Display the menu in advance, which ask you
                   what do you want with the same named files and
                   the restricted files, when you copy, move, or
                   delete multiple files.  In case of too many
                   target files, it avoids the occurrence of que-
                   ry after waiting for a moment.  Any value ex-
                   cept 00 and null effects valid.

     PPRROOGGRREESSSSBBAARR   Display the progress bar, which indicates the
                   progress, when you copy, move, or delete files.
                   It needs the time to calculate the progress,
                   to make the processing time a little longer
                   than no progress bar.  Any value except 00 and

                   individual value for each pseudo terminal, so
                   that you should change value of the variable
                   on the pseudo terminal to change the input

                   menu while you are handling the pseudo termi-
                   nal.  You can describe the same key name as
                   bbiinndd command.  You can select the following
                   items in the pseudo terminal menu: "SendAsIs",
                   "InputCode", "Break", "NextWindow" and "Kanji".
                   Each item means respectively: sending the pseu-

                   to the next window, invoking the Kana-Kanji
                   IME.  In "InputCode", you can use the key name
                   like as bbiinndd command, and also the Kanji code
                   number used in the Kana-Kanji IME mode.  But
                   you cannot select "NextWindow" in the non-

                   opened and enable you to handle simultaneously
                   multiple external commands via terminals.  If
                   the terminal in use can not provide some func-
                   tions required for the terminal emulation, the

                   Extension, for the OS which cannot support
                   RockRidge Extension.  You can specify multiple

                   enough to specify only the top directory
                   mounted by CD-ROM, then the pseudo RockRidge
                   Extension function is valid in all of the
                   directories under that directory.  This is no
                   more than a pseudo extension, which only
                   replaces filenames according to TRANS.TBL, and
                   cannot handle some CD-ROM which has an incon-
                   sistent TRANS.TBL.  No mount point is speci-
                   fied by default.

                   If you specify the value of 100-113, it is
                   sorted according to the value indicated by
                   lower 2 digits just after invoked, the last
                   specified sorted type is kept when moving
                   directory.  If you specify the value of 200-
                   213, the last sort type will be kept also
                   after invoking the archive browser.

                   is dduummbb, uunnkknnoowwnn or uunn, it is regarded as
                   the dumb terminal to suppress any escape
                   sequences in the internal shell in spite of
                   DDUUMMBBSSHHEELLLL.  If this value does not exist in

                   cutable only when it is invoked as ffddsshh.
                   The terminal name will be variable dynami-
                   cally, then you can re-specify the suitable
                   one as this value after invoked for some

     TTHHRRUUAARRGGSS      Pass through the pathnames as is, which is

                   the given pathname by itself, because the ob-
                   solete low-level shell cannot support these
                   expansion extended by POSIX.  FFdd can sometimes
                   expand the pathname given by the shell into
                   the unexpected string as a result of duplicate
                   expansion, because the latest high-level shell
                   generally support these expansion.  This vari-
                   able will be suppress the expansion of argu-

                   by uummaasskk the builtin command is prior, then

     NNOOCCOONNVVPPAATTHH    Specify the Kanji code for filename per direc-
                   tory, which is prior to FFNNAAMMEEKKCCOODDEE.  You can
                   specify multiple pathnames separating with
                   '::'.  You are enough to specify only the top
                   directory where you want to use the Kanji
                   code, then you can use the Kanji code in all
                   of the directories under that directory.  In
                   the directory which is described in
                   NNOOCCOONNVVPPAATTHH, no Kanji code is converted ignor-
                   ing the value of FFNNAAMMEEKKCCOODDEE.  No pathname is
                   specified by default.  ((UUNNIIXX))

     FFdd processes the Kanji character-set to input/output as
     "EUC-JP" or "Shift JIS" according to setting in compile.
     The the pathname including Kanji is displayed in considera-
     tion for the 2nd byte character in Kanji.  You can dynami-
     cally select Kanji code to input/output with LLAANNGGUUAAGGEE,
     IINNPPUUTTKKCCOODDEE and FFNNAAMMEEKKCCOODDEE the internal variable.  You can
     input Japanese string with the Kana-Kanji IME mode.

     You can use Kanji in the command macro and the command
     string, but cannot use Kanji as the value of the internal
     variables.  You cannot use the multibyte symbol character as
     the meta character, such as '%%' and '""' and so on, Kanji
     character is not counted as 1 character in the wildcard
     search.

     And when you give the non-standard Kanji code for the OS to
     the shell with the parameter macro such as %%JJJJ, some Kanji
     is converted into the code including the meta character such
     as '$$' and '\\' and so on, to cause unexpected behavior.  In
     that case, you can probably avoid it by quoting the string
     to be converted with %%''.

     The original "FD" for MS-DOS was created and released by
     A.Idei <SDI00544@niftyserve.or.jp> for the first time, in
     1989.  FFdd was created for UNIX from scratch following that
     implementation, in 1995.

     Some terminals cannot send the input of certain function
     keys and special keys.  The sequence compatible with VVTT220000
     is assigned as the default sequence which is not registered
     in tteerrmmccaapp(5), and when the terminal cannot support this,
     the key receipt or the screen control due to be brought by
     this is not available.

     When files in an archive file are packed with a pathname
     including "..", the archive browser cannot work normally.
     The symbolic links in an archive file cannot be unpacked
     individually.

     The user interface is cheap.
