     ffdd is a file & directory maintenance tool considered for the
     text terminals on general UNIX.  It aims for a clone of the
     same named utility which is made for the PC/AT compatible
     machine and PC-9800 series.  In fact, it is upper compatible
     functionally.

     ffdd shows the browser screen listing files when you have
     invoked it.  You can input some key which is bound each com-
     mand, to execute various operations.

     (In the following description, ((UUNNIIXX)) means that the opera-
     tion is implemented only on UNIX version and not effective
     on MS-DOS version.  As well as it, ((DDOOSS)) means that the
     operation is implemented only on MS-DOS version.)

     OOppttiioonnss
     The command line option is used for setting internal shell
     operations and setting the internal variables described
     below.  You can use any variable name as the internal vari-
     able, but ffdd can accept only those which are described in
     the below section of EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS.  If you specify
     _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y, the current directory is moved to the directory
     initially.

     The following options are available for the internal shell.

     --cc _s_t_r_i_n_g
          Commands described by _s_t_r_i_n_g are executed and exit
          immediately.  It is effective only when it is invoked
          as ffddsshh.

     --ii   If the --ii flag is present or if the standard
          input/output is a terminal, the shell is interactive
          shell.

     --ss   If the --ss flag is present or if no _a_r_g_s is specified,
          commands for the shell are read from the standard
          input.  Any remaining argument specifies the positional
          parameter.

     --rr   The shell is a restricted shell.  Specifically, the
          following operations are disallowed.

     ffdd has the 3 major screen modes.  In the browser screen, you
     can select from the file list and execute each command.  In
     the archive browser screen, files in the archive file are
     listed separately by directory, and you can browse as well
     as the browser screen.  In the tree screen, you can move on
     the directory tree and select the directory path.

     In all screen modes, each 33 lines on the top/bottom of the
     screen are used for the various information of ffdd.. The top
     information lines sometimes become 44 lines.  The screen lay-
     out is the following.

     line#     Description

     11         The title line.  The clock at the right end is
               updated every 1100 seconds.

     22         The information line.  It displays informations in
               this order: the current page (and the total
               pages), the number of marks (ant the total marks),
               the sorted type, the pattern string for file
               search.

     33         The path line.  It displays the fullpath of the
               current directory.  In the archive browser screen,
               it displays the fullpath of the archive file and
               the current path in the archive.

     22 (optional)
               The file size information line.  It displays the
               total size of the marked files in the directory
               (and the total size of all files), the total capa-
               city and the free size of the file system includ-
               ing the current directory.  This line appears by
               SSIIZZEEIINNFFOO the environment variable setting.  When
               this line is displayed, The information line and
               the path line are displayed 1 line under each.

     bboottttoomm -- 22
               The stack line.  It displays files temporarily
               which you push in stack, when arranging files.

     bboottttoomm -- 11
               The function line.  It displays the operations of
               function keys.

     bboottttoomm    The status line.  It displays the status of the
               file on the cursor position.  It also displays
               warning messages when command is executed with
               some troubles.

     You can use the following internal commands on ffdd.  While
     any user can change the key binding for these internal com-
     mands, here shows the default key binding.  The identifier
     is used when it is executed from the command line of
     EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH command, and when the user defines the key bind-
     ing.

     The detail of each internal command is the following.
     Internal commands with similar function are described
     together.

        MMoovvee ccuurrssoorr
             Move a cursor.

        TTuurrnn ppaaggee
             Turn to the previous/next page, when files are not
             completely held in a screen.  Also if you try to
             move out of the page with Cursor move, the page will
             be turned.

        MMoovvee ttoo tthhee ttoopp//bboottttoomm
             Move a cursor to the top/bottom of the file list.
             When the list is not held in a screen, the page is
             turned.

        SShhiifftt ffiilleennaammee
             Shift the displayed string of filename on the cursor
             position, when the filename is longer than the
             prepared column width.  It is displayed as shifted
             to right/left by 1 character.  The display of the
             status line is also shifted simultaneously.

        CChhaannggee llaayyoouutt
             Change the number of columns into each value.  There
             are usually 22 columns per screen.  As the column
             width per file is changed according to the number of
             columns, the displayed information is also changed.

        MMaarrkk ffiillee
             Mark the file on the cursor position.  You cannot
             mark any directory.  [SSppaaccee] marks and moves down a
             cursor.  [^^SSppaaccee] also marks and moves down a cur-
             sor, but doesn't turn the page.  [HHoommee] marks all
             the files, [EEnndd] marks all the files reversely.  [**]
             additionally marks the file which matches the wild-
             card.  You must input the wildcard string whenever
             you push [**].

             Marked files are used as the target of AATTTTRR_FFIILLEE,
             CCOOPPYY_FFIILLEE, DDEELLEETTEE_FFIILLEE, MMOOVVEE_FFIILLEE, UUNNPPAACCKK_FFIILLEE and
             the user defined command macros.

        CChhaannggee ddiirreeccttoorryy
             [RReettuurrnn] changes the current directory to the direc-
             tory on the cursor position.  If you want to change
             it to the parent directory, you should move a cursor
             to the file of ".." and push [RReettuurrnn], or simply
             push [BBss].  [\\] changes the current directory to the
             root directory.

        PPuusshh//ppoopp ffiillee ssttaacckk
             [DDeell] pushes the file on the cursor position to the
             file stack, and temporarily deletes the file from
             the file list screen.  You can push files to the
             file stack up to 55 files.

             [IInnss] pops the file from the file stack and insert
             it on the cursor position.  The last pushed file is
             popped first.  But this order is expediently
             displayed in ffdd, and it is reset by Directory move.

        RReeddrraaww ssccrreeeenn
             Redraw the file list screen by rereading the infor-
             mation of the current directory.  It is useful when
             some other process add/delete files, or when some-
             thing break the screen display.

             Moreover, when you use the terminal which doesn't
             raise SSIIGGWWIINNCCHH signal at changing the screen size
             (like kktteerrmm(1) on HP-UX etc.), you must intention-
             ally redraw after you change the screen size.

        CChhaannggee llooggiiccaall ddiirreeccttoorryy (Logdir)
             Change the current directory to the inputted path-
             name.  When you input the pathname which starts with
             '/', it means not the relative move but the absolute
             move.

             When you input the pathname "..", the pathname of the
             current directory is adjusted into absolute expres-
             sion.  Except this case, the current directory
             always is shown as the virtual pathname, by reason
             of a link and so on.  When you input the pathname
             "??", you can move to the current directory when ffdd
             was invoked.  When you input the pathname "--", you
             can move to the last visited directory.

             Moreover, When you input the pathname "@@" in floppy
             drive, you can move to the directory on UNIX file
             system, where you existed before moving to floppy
             drive.  ((UUNNIIXX))

             (Note: This command is called as "Loddsk" in the
             original FD on MS-DOS, which is short for "LOGical
             DiSK drive".  This "logical" means the drive name
             prefixed to pathnames, and it is virtually named
             against "physical disk drive".  On UNIX, since "log-
             ical disk drive" never means pathname nor directory,
             this command name "Change logical directory" is not
             suitable.  But this name is expediently inherited
             from the original version.)

        EExxeeccuuttee ffiillee (eXec)
             Execute the file on the cursor position with some
             parameters, as the child process.  The cursor posi-
             tion in command line exists after the filename in
             case of the executable file, and before the filename
             except it.  You should fill suitable parameters or
             command name in each case.  The up/down cursor keys
             can provide the command history which you executed
             before.

             On MS-DOS version, the LFN form filename in the com-
             mand line which is quoted with the quotation mark ""
             is automatically replaced into 8+3 form filename
             before execution.  In this case, when there is the
             filename described by the string quoted with "", this
             string is always replaced into 8+3 form filename
             after deleting "", otherwise it is never replaced
             including "".

        CCooppyy ffiillee (Copy)
             Copy the file on the cursor position to the speci-
             fied directory.  When the cursor position indicates
             a directory, its contents are copied recursively.
             When some files are marked, the target is not the
             file on the cursor position but the marked files.

             When the same named file exists in the destination,
             you can select the operation from the following:
             "Update (by timestamp)", "Rename (each copied
             file)", "Overwrite", "Not_copy_the_same_name", "For-
             ward".  If you select "Forward", you should specify
             the directory as the destination to forward.  All
             files which have the same names are moved to the
             specified directory.

        DDeelleettee ffiillee (Delete)
             Delete the file on the cursor position.  No direc-
             tory can be deleted.  When some files are marked,
             the target is not the file on the cursor position
             but the marked files.

             When you don't have write permission on the file,
             you are confirmed for security.

        RReennaammee ffiillee (Rename)
             Rename the file on the cursor position.  You cannot
             rename to the same name as any existent file.  When
             you specify the pathname with some directory name,
             it is also moved to the directory.

        SSoorrtt ffiillee (Sort)
             Sort files in the current directory.  You can select
             the sorted type from the following: "fileName",
             "Extension", "Size", "Timestamp", "Length (of
             filename)", and specify "Up (incremental order)" or
             "Down (decremental order)".  When the sorted type
             before sorting is the one except "No chg (not
             sort)", the choice will include "No chg".  When you
             sort after sorting another sorted type, the previous
             sorted result is based in sorting.  This sorting has
             a priority except specified type, the directory is
             always precedes any file, except for the case of "No
             chg".  In case of "Length", files which have the
             same filename length are sorted in order of their
             names.

             But this sorting is expediently displayed in ffdd, and
             it is reset by Directory move.

        FFiinndd ffiillee (Find)
             Find the files matching the wildcard, and display
             only them.  The filename which starts with '.'
             doesn't match the wildcard which starts with '*' nor
             '?'.  If you want to cancel the File find, you
             should move the current directory, or do FFIINNDD_FFIILLEE
             again and input a null line.

             When the current directory has the files which have
             the extension registered to associate with an
             archive browser, the string which starts with '/' is
             used to find not the filename but the filename in
             archive files, and only the archive files which con-
             tain matched files are displayed.  This function is
             available in the archive browser.

             After Find file, you can not do WWRRIITTEE_DDIIRR.

        DDiissppllaayy ttrreeee ssccrreeeenn (Tree)
             Display the directory tree based on the current
             directory.  You can select the directory in the tree
             screen, to move the current directory.

        EEddiitt ffiillee (Editor)
             Edit the file on the cursor position.  The editor is
             used referring EEDDIITTOORR the internal variable, or
             referring EEDDIITTOORR the environment variable when the
             internal variable is undefined.

        UUnnppaacckk ffiillee (Unpack)
             Unpack the archive file on the cursor position into
             the specified directory.  In builtin configuration,
             you can unpack only the tar file and its compressed
             file and the LHa compressed file.  You can describe
             configurations in the initial configuration file to
             support archivers except these.

        CChhaannggee aattttrriibbuuttee (Attr)
             Change the file access mode and the timestamp of the
             file on the cursor position.  When some files are
             marked, the target is not the file on the cursor
             position but the marked files.  In case of the
             marked files, you must select the mode or the times-
             tamp, before changing it all together.

             When you input the mode, cursor keys move a cursor
             to the position you want to change, [SSppaaccee] reverses
             the attribute on the position.  You should notice
             that the attribute of the execution bit is not a
             binary toggle but a triple toggle, which includes
             setuid bit, setgid bit, and sticky bit respectively.
             When you input the timestamp, you move a cursor to
             the position you want to change, and input a numeric
             value.  Finally, [RReettuurrnn] executes the change.  You
             can cancel with [EEsscc].  Be careful that the limit
             check of date is not perfect.

             Moreover, [aa](Attr), [dd](Date), [tt](Time) move a
             cursor to the each beginning of input line.

             On the OS which has the attribute of file flags, you
             can change the file flags as well as the mode.  But
             the value of flags which you can change is based on
             your permission.

        FFiillee ssyysstteemm iinnffoorrmmaattiioonn (Info)
             Display the information of the specified file sys-
             tem.  When the inputted pathname is not the special
             file which indicates a file system, the information
             of the file system including the pathname is
             displayed.

        MMoovvee ffiillee (Move)
             Move the file on the cursor position to the speci-
             fied directory.  When the cursor position indicates
             a directory, the directory itself is moved.  When
             some files are marked, the target is not the file on
             the cursor position but the marked files.

             When the same named file exists in the destination,
             you can select the operation as well as CCOOPPYY_FFIILLEE.
             When the destination belongs to the different file
             system, copy and delete are just executed continu-
             ously.

        DDeelleettee ddiirreeccttoorryy (rmDir)
             Delete the directory on the cursor position recur-
             sively.  When the directory in a symbolic link, only
             the link is deleted and the linked directory has no
             effect.

        MMaakkee ddiirreeccttoorryy (mKdir)
             Make the sub directory on the current directory.
             When the inputted sub directory string includes '/',
             which is the pathname delimiter, it goes on making
             directory recursively until the directory described
             by the string is finally created.

             When you input the pathname which starts with '/',
             the directory is made not on the current directory
             but on the absolute path described.

        EExxeeccuuttee cchhiilldd pprroocceessss (sHell)
             Execute the inputted command string as the child
             process, by handling the internal shell.  You can
             refer the command history and use automatic LFN
             replacement, as well as EEXXEECCUUTTEE_FFIILLEE.  When you push
             only [RReettuurrnn] without any input, the user shell
             which is described by SSHHEELLLL the internal variable or
             the environment variable is invoked.  In this case,
             you should input "eexxiitt" to return to ffdd.  When the
             value of SSHHEELLLL is ffddsshh, the internal shell is exe-
             cuted as the interactive shell.

             However, when there is the same command name as a
             builtin command or a internal command, the builtin
             command or the internal command are executed instead
             of the external command.  You can refer the clause
             of `BBuuiillttiinn CCoommmmaannddss' for the details of the builtin
             command.

        WWrriittee ddiirreeccttoorryy (Write)
             Write the displayed directory.  The gap between
             files on the directory entry is filled.  When it is
             executed after arranged by PPUUSSHH_FFIILLEE, PPOOPP_FFIILLEE and
             SSOORRTT_DDIIRR, the result is written.

             When the displayed directory doesn't belong to the
             hierarchy under your home directory, you are con-
             firmed for security whether if any other user
             doesn't use the directory.  Since it is insecure,
             you cannot write the NFS mounted directory and some
             special directories.

             If you execute the internal command which arranges
             the file order, and then try to execute the internal
             command which will break that order, you will be
             confirmed whether if you write the directory or not,
             just before the internal command is executed.  For
             this function, you can write the directory without
             intentionally executing this Directory write com-
             mand.  But when the displayed directory is not under
             your home directory, this confirmation is not done.

        BBaacckkuupp ttaappee (Backup)
             Backup the file on the cursor position into the
             specified storage device.  When the cursor position
             indicates a directory, all of its contents are
             backuped.  When some files are marked, the target is
             not the file on the cursor position but the marked
             files.

             ttaarr(1) is used for backup.  When you specify the
             filename except special files indicates devices as
             input of the device name, the archive file is
             created with that filename.

        VViieeww ffiillee (View)
             View the file on the cursor position.  The pager is
             used referring PPAAGGEERR the internal variable, or
             referring PPAAGGEERR the environment variable when the
             internal variable is undefined.

        PPaacckk ffiillee (Pack)
             Pack the file on the cursor position into the speci-
             fied archive file.  When the cursor position indi-
             cates a directory, all of its contents are packed
             into the archive file.  When some files are marked,
             the target is not the file on the cursor position
             but the marked files.

             According to the extension of the inputted archive
             file, the associated archiver is automatically
             selected.  In builtin configuration, you can pack
             only the tar file and its compressed file and the
             LHa compressed file.  You can describe configura-
             tions in the initial configuration file to support
             archivers except these.

             When you use ttaarr(1), you may sometimes be unable to
             pack a lot of files at once, because of the maximum
             parameter length which can be given at once.  In
             those case, you can create the archive file with
             BBAACCKKUUPP_TTAAPPEE.

        OOppeerraattiioonnss wwiitthh ttrreeee
             [LL], [CC], [MM] and [UU] can make you select the path-
             name from the directory tree instead of the string
             input.  They execute the internal command equivalent
             to LLOOGG_DDIIRR, CCOOPPYY_FFIILLEE, MMOOVVEE_FFIILLEE and UUNNPPAACCKK_FFIILLEE,
             respectively.

        FFiinndd ffiillee rreeccuurrssiivveellyy
             Find the file matching the wildcard recursively
             under the current directory, and move the directory
             where the found file exists.  When the cursor posi-
             tion indicates a directory, it find the file under
             the directory on the cursor position instead of the
             current directory.

             You will be confirmed for each matching file whether
             if you move or not, and you can select [nn](No)
             unless the target file is displayed.

        IInnvvookkee llaauunncchheerr
             [RReettuurrnn] executes the operation according to the
             extension of the file on the cursor position, unless
             the cursor position indicates a directory.  In buil-
             tin configuration, the archive browser is registered
             with the tar file and its compressed file and the
             LHa compressed file.  You can describe configura-
             tions in the initial configuration file to register
             launchers except these.

             When the file on the cursor position has the unre-
             gistered extension, it will behave as same as
             VVIIEEWW_FFIILLEE.  In the archive browser, the registered
             launcher is available, so that you can invoke the
             archive browser recursively.

        SSwwiittcchh ssyymmbboolliicc lliinnkk mmooddee
             In case of the symbolic link file, the file informa-
             tion displayed in the file column and the status
             line shows not the status of its referential file
             but the status of the link itself.  It switches to
             show the status of the referential file.  ((UUNNIIXX))

             In the mode of showing the status of the referential
             file, 'SS'(Symbolic Link) is displayed on the left
             end of the function line.

        SSwwiittcchh ffiillee ttyyppee ssyymmbbooll mmooddee
             Switch to display the symbol which means the file

             some OS, instead of the file mode on each file.  It
             is toggle to switch if display the file flag or the
             file mode.  This is not available on any OS without
             the file flag.  The each symbol means the following

     In EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH and the initial configuration file, you can
     use the internal commands described above and the builtin
     commands described below, as well as the external commands.
     With these commands, a pipeline can consist of one or more
     commands separated by || or ||&&.  || connects the standard out-
     put of the previous command to the standard input of the
     next command.  ||&& connects both the standard output and the
     standard error output of the previous command to the stan-
     dard input of the next command.  The exit status of a pipe-
     line is the exit status of the last command.  You can start
     a pipeline with !!, then the exit status of a pipeline will
     be the logical NOT of the exit status of the last command.
     Moreover, a command list can consist of one or more pipe-
     lines separated by ;;, &&, &&||, &&&&, ||||.  This command list can
     end with ;;, && or &&||.  These separators mean the following.
        ;;    Execute commands sequentially.
        &&    Execute commands synchronously, not waiting for the
             preceding pipeline to finish.  ((UUNNIIXX))
        &&||   Same as &&, except to immediately ddiissoowwnn the job.
             ((UUNNIIXX))
        &&&&   Execute the following pipeline only if the preceding
             pipeline returns a 00 exit status.
        ||||   Execute the following pipeline only if the preceding
             pipeline returns a non-00 exit status.
     In these command lists, a newline means as same as ;;.

     The input/output of each command in the command list can be
     redirected with the following redirectees.  These
     redirectees can be placed on any position in the command
     string.
        _n<<_f_i_l_e    Redirect the input indicated by the file
                  descriptor _n into the input from _f_i_l_e.  If _n is
                  omitted, it is regarded as the standard input
                  is specified.
        _n>>_f_i_l_e    Redirect the output indicated by the file
                  descriptor _n into the output to _f_i_l_e.  If _n is
                  omitted, it is regarded as the standard output
                  is specified.  If _f_i_l_e doesn't exist it is
                  created, otherwise it is truncated to 0 length
                  before output.
        _n>>||_f_i_l_e   Same as >>, except to force to overwrite
                  existent files even if --CC option is set by sseett
                  the builtin command.
        _n>>>>_f_i_l_e   Redirect the output indicated by the file
                  descriptor _n into the output to _f_i_l_e.  If _n is
                  omitted, it is regarded as the standard output
                  is specified.  If _f_i_l_e doesn't exist it is
                  created, otherwise output is appended to it.
        _n_1<<&&_n_2    Redirect the input indicated by the file
                  descriptor _n_1 into the input indicated by the
                  file descriptor _n_2.  If _n_1 is omitted, it is
                  regarded as the standard input is specified.
        _n_1>>&&_n_2    Redirect the output indicated by the file
                  descriptor _n_1 into the output indicated by the
                  file descriptor _n_2.  If _n_1 is omitted, it is
                  regarded as the standard output is specified.
        &&>>_f_i_l_e    Redirect both the standard output and the stan-
                  dard error output into the output to _f_i_l_e.  If
                  _f_i_l_e doesn't exist it is created, otherwise it
                  is truncated to 0 length before output.
        &&>>||_f_i_l_e   Same as &&>>, except to force to overwrite
                  existent files even if --CC option is set by sseett
                  the builtin command.
        &&>>>>_f_i_l_e   Redirect both the standard output and the stan-
                  dard error output into the output to _f_i_l_e.  If
                  _f_i_l_e doesn't exist it is created, otherwise
                  output is appended to it.
        _n<<>>_f_i_l_e
        _n>><<_f_i_l_e   Redirect both the input/output indicated by the
                  file descriptor _n into the input/output from/to
                  _f_i_l_e.  If _n is omitted, it is regarded as the
                  standard input is specified.
        _n<<--
        _n<<&&--      Close the input indicated by the file descrip-
                  tor _n.  If _n is omitted, it is regarded as the
                  standard input is specified.
        _n>>--
        _n>>&&--      Close the output indicated by the file descrip-
                  tor _n.  If _n is omitted, it is regarded as the
                  standard output is specified.
        _n<<<<[--]_w_o_r_d
                  Redirect the input indicated by the file
                  descriptor _n into the input which is read up to
                  a input line as same as _w_o_r_d, or to an end of
                  file.  If any part of _w_o_r_d is quoted, no input
                  line is evaluated.  Otherwise, each input line
                  is evaluated to expand variables or replace
                  strings.  When you specify --, all tabs on the
                  beginning of input lines is stripped to be send
                  to a command.  If _n is omitted, it is regarded
                  as the standard input is specified.

     On each command line, the string from '##' to the end of line
     and a null line are ignored.  When the line ends with '\\',
     it is referred as continuing into the next line, so that you
     can split a long line with this.

     BBuuiillttiinn CCoommmmaannddss
     ffdd has the following builtin commands.  These builtin com-
     mands can be used in EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH and the initial configura-
     tion file.

     iiff _l_i_s_t tthheenn [eelliiff _l_i_s_t tthheenn _l_i_s_t] ... [eellssee _l_i_s_t] ffii
                   The _l_i_s_t of iiff clause and eelliiff clauses are
                   executed in order, and if each exit status is
                   a 0, then the _l_i_s_t of tthheenn clause associated
                   with it is executed and the eelliiff clauses after
                   it are ignored.  If no _l_i_s_t of iiff clause nor
                   eelliiff clauses return a 0, the _l_i_s_t of eellssee
                   clause is executed.  If no _l_i_s_t of tthheenn
                   clauses nor eellssee clause is executed, then iiff
                   returns a 00 exit status.

     wwhhiillee _l_i_s_t ddoo _l_i_s_t ddoonnee
                   The _l_i_s_t of wwhhiillee clause is executed repeat-
                   edly, and while its exit status is 0, the _l_i_s_t
                   of ddoo clause is executed repeatedly.  If the
                   _l_i_s_t of ddoo clause is never executed, then
                   wwhhiillee returns a 00 exit status.

     uunnttiill _l_i_s_t ddoo _l_i_s_t ddoonnee
                   The _l_i_s_t of uunnttiill clause is executed repeat-
                   edly, and while its exit status is NOT 0, the
                   _l_i_s_t of ddoo clause is executed repeatedly.  If
                   the _l_i_s_t of ddoo clause is never executed, then
                   uunnttiill returns a 00 exit status.

     ffoorr _N_A_M_E [iinn _v_a_l_u_e ...] ddoo _l_i_s_t ddoonnee
                   _N_A_M_E the internal variable is substituted for
                   values of _v_a_l_u_e one by one, and _l_i_s_t is exe-
                   cuted according to the each value.  If iinn
                   _v_a_l_u_e is omitted, then each positional
                   parameter is substituted one by one.

     ccaassee _w_o_r_d iinn [_p_a_t_t_e_r_n [|| _p_a_t_t_e_r_n] ... )) _l_i_s_t ;;;;] ... eessaacc
                   The string _w_o_r_d is compared with the each _p_a_t_-
                   _t_e_r_n, _l_i_s_t associated with the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n which
                   first matches it is executed.

     ((_l_i_s_t))        Execute _l_i_s_t in a sub shell.

     {{ _l_i_s_t;; }}     Execute _l_i_s_t in the current shell.

     _N_A_M_E==[_v_a_l_u_e] [_c_o_m ...]
                   Define a internal variable which is available
                   only in ffdd.  It substitutes the value (string)
                   _v_a_l_u_e for _N_A_M_E the internal variable.  When
                   you describe the command _c_o_m after the defini-
                   tion of a variable, _c_o_m is executed on the
                   state where this variable is regarded as the
                   environment variable.  In this case, the
                   definition of _N_A_M_E is not remain as the
                   environment variable nor the internal vari-
                   able.

                   If _v_a_l_u_e is omitted, the value of _N_A_M_E the
                   internal variable is defined as a null.  If
                   you want to delete the definition of a inter-
                   nal variable, use uunnsseett the builtin command.

     _n_a_m_e(()) {{ _l_i_s_t; }}
                   Define a function whose body is _l_i_s_t, as the
                   name of _n_a_m_e.  The defined function can be
                   used in the command line of EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH and
                   each command macro described below.  You can
                   use the positional parameter $$_n in each
                   description of _l_i_s_t, which indicates the argu-
                   ment when the function is invoked.  $$00 is _n_a_m_e
                   itself, and $$11-$$99 indicates each argument.

                   Although you cannot omit {{ }} and _l_i_s_t, you can
                   omit {{ }} before/after _l_i_s_t which consists of a
                   single command.  If you want to delete the
                   definition of a function, use uunnsseett the buil-
                   tin command.

     !!_n_u_m          Execute the command which has the history
                   number specified with the numeric value _n_u_m.
                   When _n_u_m is negative value, it executes the
                   command which has the history number as the
                   current history number minus _n_u_m.

     !!!!            Execute the previous command.  This is synonym
                   for !!--11.

     !!_s_t_r          Execute the command history which starts with
                   the string _s_t_r.

     :: [_a_r_g ...]   No effect.  But it evaluates _a_r_g and performs
                   redirection.

                   must exists on the directory which PPAATTHH
                   includes, or be described with pathname.  The

                   EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH.  You can describe this in the file
                   as nesting.

     aalliiaass [_n_a_m_e[==_c_o_m]]
                   Define a alias whose body is _c_o_m, as the name
                   of _n_a_m_e.  The defined alias can be used in the
                   command line of EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH and each command
                   macro described below.  The alias substitution
                   is performed recursively.

                   If _c_o_m is omitted, the alias of _n_a_m_e is
                   displayed.  If both _c_o_m and _n_a_m_e are omitted,
                   all the current alias definition list is
                   displayed.

     aarrcchh _e_x_t [_p_a_c_k _u_n_p_a_c_k]
                   Register the archiver command associated with
                   the archive file which has _e_x_t the extension.
                   The pack command is specified as _p_a_c_k, and the
                   unpack command is specified as _u_n_p_a_c_k, using
                   the macro representation quoted with "".  When
                   _e_x_t starts with //, uppercase/lowercase is
                   ignored in the comparison of any extension.

                   If both _p_a_c_k and _u_n_p_a_c_k are omitted, the
                   archiver command registration for _e_x_t the

     bbgg [_j_o_b]      Continue the execution of the job specified
                   with _j_o_b in the background.  The following
                   format is available to specify a job.  ((UUNNIIXX))

                         %%_s_t_r the job whose command line starts with _s_t_r
                   But, you must describe these %% in the command
                   line of EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH as the duplicated expres-
                   sion, such as %%%%, for the reason of the param-
                   eter macro function described below.

                   If _j_o_b is omitted, the current job is contin-
                   ued in the background.

     bbiinndd _c [_c_o_m_1 [_c_o_m_2] [::_c_o_m_m_e_n_t]]
                   Bind the command _c_o_m_1 to the key _c.  When you
                   want to specify a control character for _c, you
                   can prefix ^^ into 2 characters, such as ^A.
                   When you want to specify a character with the
                   META key (or the ALT key on MS-DOS version),
                   you can prefix @@ into 2 characters, such as
                   @a.  When you want to specify a function key
                   and a special key, you can use each identifier
                   described in kkeeyymmaapp command after, such as
                   F10.  Or you can describe the escape sequence,
                   such as \\nn and \\ee, and the octal expression,
                   such as \\oooooo.

                   In case of binding the internal command of ffdd,
                   you can the command identifier as it is.  When
                   you want to define the internal command with
                   some arguments or define the command in the
                   macro representation, you should describe the
                   string quoted with "".  If _c_o_m_2 is not omitted,
                   _c_o_m_2 is executed when the cursor position
                   indicates a directory.  When the key _c is the
                   function key of F1-F10, if you describe _c_o_m_-
                   _m_e_n_t prefixed with :: trailing the command
                   description, you can change the display of
                   associated part in the function line into _c_o_m_-
                   _m_e_n_t.

                   However, note that, with the key binding for
                   the control key, the configuration in the edit
                   mode described below is prior to the key bind-
                   ing.

                   If both _c_o_m_1 and _c_o_m_2 are omitted, the regis-
                   tration of key binding for the key _c is
                   deleted.

                   Execute _c_o_m the command, and invoke the
                   archive browser who receives its output.  You
                   should the macro representation quoted with ""
                   as _c_o_m.  --ff, --tt, --bb, --ii and --ee options are the
                   same as the one for llaauunncchh the builtin com-
                   mand.  In case that multiple _c_o_ms are
                   specified, the next _c_o_m the command is exe-
                   cuted one after another when you select each
                   files in the archive browser, and the formats
                   and patterns described after each _c_o_m the com-
                   mand are adopted.  In order to return to the
                   previous level of archive browser, you should
                   select the file named as .... or push the key
                   [BBss].  Or you can use QQUUIITT_SSYYSSTTEEMM the command
                   to escape from all of the archive browsers
                   invoked by bbrroowwssee.  You must describe --ff
                   option, except for the last _c_o_m the command.
                   When the last _c_o_m has no --ff option, the com-
                   mand has been just executed instead of invok-
                   ing an archive browser, and then will return
                   to the previous archive browser when it is
                   done.

                   When you specify --pp option, the execution of
                   _c_o_m_2 the command precedes the execution of the
                   next _c_o_m the command when you select a file.
                   While _c_o_m is executed in the sub shell for a
                   pipeline, _c_o_m_2 is executed in the current
                   shell to inherit the values of internal vari-
                   ables set in this command after _c_o_m_2 has been
                   done.  The filenames which is selected toward
                   this level of archive browser are held in
                   positional parameters sequentially, and the
                   last selected filename is held in $$11.  These
                   parameters will be newly set whenever you
                   select a file, so that they are reset in
                   sequential order when you select the next file
                   even if you replace them with sseett or sshhiifftt the
                   builtin command.  --dd and --nn options specify a
                   control if the selected file is a directory or
                   not respectively.  When you specify nnoopprreepp,
                   _c_o_m_2 specified by --pp option is not executed.
                   When you specify lloooopp, you don't step the next
                   _c_o_m the command but the same _c_o_m the command
                   again.

                   And when you think troublesome to describe too
                   many arguments for bbrroowwssee, you can specify
                   _f_i_l_e the file in which some arguments are
                   described with --@@ option.  You can describe --@@
                   option in any place of arguments, the argu-
                   ments described in _f_i_l_e are inserted in the
                   place where --@@ is described.  If you specify --
                   as _f_i_l_e, arguments are read from the standard
                   input instead of the file.  You should
                   describe arguments in _f_i_l_e with spaces or new-
                   lines as separator.  The null line and the
                   line started with ## will be ignored.  When you
                   describe --@@ option in _f_i_l_e, the argument file
                   is referred recursively.

     ccdd [--LLPP] [_d_i_r]
     cchhddiirr [--LLPP] [_d_i_r]
                   Change the current directory in ffdd to _d_i_r.  If
                   _d_i_r is omitted, it moves to the directory
                   indicated by HHOOMMEE the internal variable.  If
                   you specify the pathname as "..", "??", "--",
                   "@@", it behaves like as LLOOGG_DDIIRR.

                   If --LL is specified, the logical pathname fol-
                   lowing symbolic links is used.  If --PP is
                   specified, the physical pathname following no
                   symbolic links is used.  Otherwise, the pphhyyssii--
                   ccaall option for sseett the builtin command is
                   effective.

     cchheecckkiidd [_f_i_l_e ...]
                   Calculate the unique ID of the specified file
                   and display it, according to the MD5 algorithm
                   in RFC1321.  When you specify multiple _f_i_l_es,
                   the IDs of all specified files are calculated
                   and displayed.  When you specify nothing, the
                   ID of running ffdd itself is displayed.

                   Since this algorithm is guaranteed to be
                   secure, it is available to confirm the iden-
                   tity of files.

     ccoommmmaanndd [--pp | --vv | --VV] _a_r_g ...
                   Execute _a_r_g as a simple command.  When the
                   same named function is defined, the function
                   will not be executed.  If --pp is specified, the
                   default value of PPAATTHH is used to search the
                   path.  If --vv is specified, the absolute path
                   for _a_r_g is displayed instead of executing _a_r_g.
                   In this case, _a_r_g the builtin command will
                   cause simply its name.  If --VV is specified,
                   verbose description for _a_r_g is displayed as
                   same as ttyyppee.

                   the loop _n - 1 levels out of the loop.

                   Copy the file indicated by _s_r_c into the file
                   or the directory indicated by _d_e_s_t.  When _d_e_s_t
                   indicates a directory, the filename in the
                   destination is _s_r_c.  If _d_e_s_t is omitted, it is
                   copied into the current directory.  You can
                   specify multiple source files by describing to
                   separate them with ++, or by using the wild-
                   card.  When you separate them with ++, those
                   files are concatenated and copied.  When you
                   use the wildcard, they are copied one by one
                   in case that the destination is a directory,
                   and they are concatenated in case that the
                   destination is a file.

                   When you specify --AA, it is treated as the
                   ASCII text file.  When you specify --BB, it is
                   treated as the binary file.  When you specify
                   --VV, it is verified to copy.  When you specify
                   --YY, it doesn't prompts for confirming to
                   overwrite into the destination.  When you
                   specify ----YY, it prompts for confirmation
                   before overwriting into the destination.

                   only names of files and directories.  When you
                   specify --LL, it uses lowercase.  When you
                   specify --VV, it lists the verbose information.
                   When you specify --44, it displays year with 4

                   Echo _a_r_g to the standard output.  When you
                   don't specify --nn, newline is added to output
                   trailing after _a_r_g.  See eecchhoo(1) for details.

                   Evaluate parameter macros included in _a_r_g and
                   execute the results.  Since eevvaall doesn't
                   evaluate any parameter macro, you should
                   choose them according to uses.  When in the
                   function, you cannot use any parameter macro,
                   then you need this command to extract parame-
                   ter macros.

                   You can specify _a_r_g as arguments of _c_o_m.

     eexxiitt [_n]      Exit from ffdd.  When you specify _n, it exits

     eexxppoorrtt [_N_A_M_E[==[_v_a_l_u_e]] ...]
                   Mark _N_A_M_E the internal variable to be
                   inherited to child processes as the environ-
                   ment variable.  Since then, the definition of
                   _N_A_M_E can be referred in any child process.
                   When you eexxppoorrtt the undefined internal vari-
                   able, it doesn't become the environment vari-
                   able until the internal variable is defined.
                   When you want to define the value at the same
                   time, you should specify _v_a_l_u_e.

                   If only == is specified and _v_a_l_u_e is omitted,
                   the value of _N_A_M_E the environment variable is
                   defined as a null.  If no argument is speci-
                   fied, all of the eexxppoorrtted environment vari-
                   ables are listed.  When you want to delete the
                   definition of the environment variable, you
                   can use uunnsseett the builtin command.

     ffcc [--ll | --ss [_o_l_d==_n_e_w ...]] [--nnrr ] [--ee _e_d_i_t_o_r] [_f_i_r_s_t [_l_a_s_t]]
                   List or edit command histories.  _f_i_r_s_t and
                   _l_a_s_t select the range of command histories.
                   This specification can be described as a
                   numeric value or a string.  A positive value
                   means the command history number, and a nega-
                   tive value means the command history which has
                   the history number as the current history
                   number minus the value.  A string mean the
                   command history which starts with the string.
                   If --nn is specified, command histories are
                   listed without their history numbers.  If --rr
                   is specified, command histories are listed in
                   reverse order.  If --ee is specified, the editor
                   named by _e_d_i_t_o_r is used to edit command his-
                   tories, otherwise the editor specified by
                   FFCCEEDDIITT or EEDDIITTOORR the internal variable is
                   used.

                   When --ll is specified, selected command his-
                   tories are listed to the standard output.  In
                   this case, omitting _l_a_s_t means to specify the
                   current history number, and also omitting
                   _f_i_r_s_t means to specify --1166.

                   When --ss is specified, the command history
                   selected by _f_i_r_s_t is executed immediately.  In
                   this case, omitting _f_i_r_s_t means to specify the
                   current history number.  The first occurrence
                   of the string _o_l_d in the command history will
                   be replaced by the string _n_e_w before execu-
                   tion.

                   When neither --ll nor --ss is not specified,
                   selected command histories are edited, and
                   then each edited commands are executed one by
                   one with display in the standard output.  In
                   this case, omitting _l_a_s_t means to specify
                   _f_i_r_s_t, and also omitting _f_i_r_s_t means to
                   specify the current history number for both.

     ffdd [_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y]
                   Invoke ffdd from the internal shell.  If you
                   specify _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y, the current directory is
                   moved to the directory initially.  You can
                   return to the internal shell by QQUUIITT_SSYYSSTTEEMM.
                   It is effective only when it is invoked as
                   ffddsshh.

     ffgg [_j_o_b]      Continue the execution of the job specified
                   with _j_o_b in the foreground.  The following
                   format is available to specify a job.  ((UUNNIIXX))

                         %%_n   the job with job number _n
                         %%_s_t_r the job whose command line starts with _s_t_r
                   But, you must describe these %% in the command
                   line of EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH as the duplicated expres-
                   sion, such as %%%%, for the reason of the param-
                   eter macro function described below.

                   If _j_o_b is omitted, the current job is contin-
                   ued in the foreground.

     ggeettkkeeyy [_n_u_m]  Get the key code sequence for the pushed key.
                   It prompts after executed, and displays the
                   key code sequence for the key which you push
                   to specify.  It continues until you push any
                   key _n_u_m times.  When _n_u_m is more than 11 time,
                   you can stop it with pushing [SSppaaccee].  When
                   _n_u_m is 00 time, it continues forever until
                   [SSppaaccee] is pushed.  The displayed sequence can
                   be used as the key code sequence for kkeeyymmaapp
                   command.  ((UUNNIIXX))

                   If _n_u_m is omitted, it is regarded as 11 time is
                   specified.

     ggeettooppttss _o_p_t_s_t_r _N_A_M_E [_a_r_g ...]
                   Used to parse the optional parameters from a
                   sequence of _a_r_g.  The valid characters as
                   option is described in _o_p_t_s_t_r.  An option
                   character which needs an argument is described
                   with following :: in _o_p_t_s_t_r.  Each time ggeettooppttss
                   is invoked, the new option character parsed
                   from _a_r_g is substituted for _N_A_M_E the internal
                   variable.  When the option has an argument,
                   the argument is substituted for OOPPTTAARRGG the
                   internal variable.  And the index of the next
                   parameter is substituted for OOPPTTIINNDD the inter-
                   nal variable every time.  The value of OOPPTTIINNDD
                   is initialized to 11 whenever the shell is
                   invoked, another parsing of option parameters
                   needs initializing OOPPTTIINNDD to 11 manually.  If
                   _a_r_g is omitted, positional parameters are
                   parsed to the optional parameters.

                   When the end of option is encountered, ggeettooppttss
                   will exit with the value of 11.  In this case,
                   ?? is substituted for _N_A_M_E.  When an option
                   character which is not included in _o_p_t_s_t_r is
                   found, an error message is written to the
                   standard error, then ?? is substituted for _N_A_M_E
                   and OOPPTTAARRGG is unset.  But, if OOPPTTAARRGG is
                   started with ::, no error message is written,
                   and the found option character is substituted
                   for OOPPTTAARRGG instead.  When no argument is found
                   with the option character which needs an argu-
                   ment, an error message is written to the stan-
                   dard error, then ?? is substituted for _N_A_M_E and
                   OOPPTTAARRGG is unset.  But, if OOPPTTAARRGG is started
                   with ::, no error message is written, then the
                   found option character is substituted for
                   OOPPTTAARRGG instead, and :: is substituted for _N_A_M_E.

     hhaasshh [--rr | _c_o_m ...]
                   Search the absolute path for _c_o_m referring to
                   PPAATTHH, which indicates the search path when the
                   external command is executed, and register the
                   result in the hash table.

                   When you specify --rr instead of _c_o_m, all the
                   memorized hash table are discarded.  If _c_o_m is
                   omitted, the hash table information is listed.
                   hhiittss, ccoosstt, ccoommmmaanndd indicate the number of
                   times the command has been executed, the meas-
                   ure of the work required to search it in the
                   search path, and the absolute path for the
                   command, respectively.  When the command is
                   searched in a relative directory, it is neces-
                   sary to re-search whenever the current direc-
                   tory is moved, because it is not registered as
                   the absolute path.  In such command, ** trail-
                   ing hhiittss is displayed.

                   You can also use the octal expression, such as
                   \\oooooo.  You can describe the control character
                   prefixing ^^, such as ^A.  ^^ itself can be
                   described as \\^^.

                   If _s_t_r is omitted, the key code sequence for _c
                   is displayed.  If both _s_t_r and _c are omitted,
                   all of the mappings for special keys are
                   listed.  When you specify _s_t_r as """", the key
                   code mapping for _c is canceled.

     kkiillll [--ll | --_s_i_g_n_a_l] [_p_i_d | _j_o_b ...]

                   process indicated by the process number _p_i_d or
                   to the job indicated by _j_o_b.  _s_i_g_n_a_l is
                   described as a numeric value or a signal name.

                   If _s_i_g_n_a_l is omitted, SSIIGGTTEERRMM is send.  When
                   you specify --ll, it lists the signal names
                   which can be used as _s_i_g_n_a_l instead of sending
                   a signal.

                   Register the behavior for _e_x_t the extension as
                   the launcher.  You should the macro represen-
                   tation quoted with "" as _c_o_m.  When you regis-
                   ter an archive browser, you should describe
                   the command to list the archived files as _c_o_m,
                   and describe the format of the list as _f_o_r_m_a_t.
                   When you describe _t_o_p and _b_o_t_t_o_m, you can
                   specify unnecessary lines in the list as the
                   number of lines from the top/bottom line.
                   When _e_x_t starts with //, uppercase/lowercase is
                   ignored in the comparison of any extension.

                   If _c_o_m is omitted, the launcher registration
                   for _e_x_t is canceled.

                   When you register an archive browser, you can
                   use the latter form to describe more detailed
                   control.  You can specify multiple formats as
                   candidates with multiple --ff options.  These
                   candidates for format are compared in order of
                   appearance, if no one is matched completely
                   then the nearest one is adopted.  --ii and --ee
                   options specify _p_a_t_t the pattern for the line
                   to be ignored and for the line to be treated
                   as error respectively.  When the list includes
                   unnecessary lines you can specify also _t_o_p and
                   _b_o_t_t_o_m, but you must specify lines except
                   top/bottom lines with --ii option.  In case that
                   a failure to unpack files in the archive file
                   causes outputting some strings, you can
                   specify the strings with --ee option.  --ii and --ee
                   options can specify multiple patterns, and
                   they are effective if one of them is matched.
                   And you can use a wildcard in the description
                   for each _p_a_t_t the pattern.

     mmdd _d_i_r

     llooggoouutt [_n]    Exit from a login shell.  When you specify _n,
                   it exits with the exit status _n.

     ppooppdd          Unload the top directory onto the directory
                   stack, and change the current directory in ffdd
                   to the directory.  This command is failed when
                   the directory stack is empty.

     pprriinnttaarrcchh [_e_x_t]
                   Print the archiver commands registered for the

                   If _e_x_t is omitted, all of the registered
                   archiver commands are listed.

     pprriinnttbbiinndd [_c] Print the command binded to the key _c.  You
                   can specify the key as well as bbiinndd.

                   If _c is omitted, all of the registered key
                   bindings are listed, which is defined not as
                   the internal command but as the command macro.
                   The key bindings of internal commands can be
                   referred in HHEELLPP_MMEESSSSAAGGEE.

     pprriinnttddrrvv [_c]  Print the device file and the number of

                   registered for the drive name _c.  ((UUNNIIXX))

                   If _c is omitted, all of the registered floppy
                   drives are listed.

     pprriinnttllaauunncchh [_e_x_t]
                   Print the command macro registered as the
                   launcher for _e_x_t the extension.  When it is
                   registered as the archive browser, the format
                   for listing is also printed.

                   If _e_x_t is omitted, all of the registered
                   launchers are listed.

     ppuusshhdd [_d_i_r]   Load the current directory onto the directory
                   stack, and change the current directory in ffdd
                   to _d_i_r.  If you specify the pathname as "..",
                   "??", "--", "@@", it behaves like as LLOOGG_DDIIRR.
                   The pphhyyssiiccaall option for sseett the builtin com-
                   mand is effective for symbolic links.

                   If _d_i_r is omitted, change the current direc-
                   tory to the top directory of the directory
                   stack, and replace it with the current direc-
                   tory.  In this case, this command is failed
                   when the directory stack is empty.

     ppwwdd [--LLPP]     Display the current directory with the abso-
                   lute representation.  If --LL is specified, the
                   logical pathname following symbolic links is
                   displayed.  If --PP is specified, the physical
                   pathname following no symbolic links is
                   displayed.  Otherwise, the pphhyyssiiccaall option for
                   sseett the builtin command is effective.

     rreeaadd [_N_A_M_E ...]
                   Read one line from the standard input and sub-
                   stitute that string for _N_A_M_E the internal
                   variable.  The inputted string is separated
                   with IIFFSS into some words.  When multiple _N_A_M_Es
                   are specified, words are substituted one by
                   one from the first of line, and all the rest
                   are substituted for the last _N_A_M_E.  When the
                   number of words in inputted string is less
                   than the number of _N_A_M_E, a null is substituted
                   for the rest of _N_A_M_E.

     rreeaaddlliinnee [_p_r_o_m_p_t]
                   Read one line from the terminal input and out-
                   put that string to the standard output.  When
                   _p_r_o_m_p_t is specified, the string is displayed
                   on the beginning of input line.  This command
                   differs from rreeaadd the builtin command in the
                   terminal input and the line editing.  You can-
                   not use the history as one of the line edit-
                   ing, but can use the completion for a path-
                   name.

     rreeaaddoonnllyy [_N_A_M_E[==[_v_a_l_u_e]] ...]
                   Mark _N_A_M_E the internal variable to be
                   readonly.  Since then, you cannot change the
                   value of _N_A_M_E.  When you want to define the
                   value at the same time, you should specify
                   _v_a_l_u_e.

                   If only == is specified and _v_a_l_u_e is omitted,
                   the value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable is
                   defined as a null.  If no argument is
                   specified, all of the readonly internal vari-
                   ables are listed.

     rrdd _d_i_r
     rrmmddiirr _d_i_r     Delete the directory _d_i_r.  You cannot delete
                   the non-empty directory.

     rreenn _o_l_d _n_e_w
     rreennaammee _o_l_d _n_e_w
                   Rename the filename or the directory name _o_l_d
                   into _n_e_w.  You can specify the wildcard in _o_l_d
                   and _n_e_w to rename the multiple filenames all
                   together.

     rreemm [_a_r_g ...] No effect, same as ::.

     rreettuurrnn [_n]    Return from a function with the return value
                   specified by _n.  If _n is omitted, the return
                   value is the exit status of the last executed
                   command.  It cannot be used out of a function.

                   List internal variables and functions, without
                   any argument.  When you specify _a_r_g, _a_r_g is
                   substituted for the positional parameter $$11,
                   $$22, ..., $$_n in order.  When you specify any
                   option, each option means the following.  When
                   you use ++ instead of --, the option parameter
                   turns off each option.

     sseettddrrvv _c _d_e_v_i_c_e _h_d _s_c _c_l
                   Specify the device file indicated by _d_e_v_i_c_e
                   for the MS-DOS floppy drive named as _c.  At
                   the same time, _h_d, _s_c, _c_l are specified as the
                   number of
                   heads(sides)/sectors/cylinders(tracks) in the
                   format which is treated in the driver of _d_e_v_-
                   _i_c_e.  In special case, when you want to treat
                   the 640KB2DD(hd=2/sc=8/cl=80) floppy disk with
                   the driver which can treat only the
                   820KB2DD(hd=2/sc=9/cl=80) floppy disk, you
                   should specify the value adding 110000 (108) as
                   the value of _s_c.  ((UUNNIIXX))

                   On the PC-UNIX environment which is worked on
                   PC, specifying the string HHDDDD or HHDDDD9988 instead
                   of _h_d, _s_c, _c_l, can register the MS-DOS parti-
                   tion on the hard disk for the PC/AT compatible
                   machine or PC-9800 series.  In this case, You
                   should describe the device file as the device
                   name prepared per the physical drive unit
                   rather than the device name prepared per the
                   partition (slice).  The MS-DOS partitions
                   included in the drive unit are automatically
                   expanded to the drive name after the drive
                   name _c.  When no MS-DOS partition is included
                   in the specified drive unit, this command is
                   ignored.  You can confirm what drive name is
                   valid by pprriinnttddrrvv command.  But any hard disk
                   is registered as readonly, for security.

                   positional parameters from $$11 to $$_n are dis-
                   carded.  If _n is omitted, it is regard as 11 is

                   receives the signal _n.  If _c_o_m is omitted, the
                   trap for the signal is reset.  When you
                   specify _c_o_m as a null, the signal ignored.
                   When you specify _n as 00, the command _c_o_m is
                   executed on exit.  If both _c_o_m and _n are omit-
                   ted, all of the registered traps are listed.

                   specifiable value.  ((UUNNIIXX))

                   When you specify --HH, a hard limit is set.
                   When you specify --SS, a soft limit is set.
                   When you don't specify neither of them, both
                   limits are set.  If _n is omitted, the current

                   or nn, you can select a character from
                   displayed [[YY//NN]] with cursor keys and push
                   [RReettuurrnn] to be regarded as an input of the

     Since representing the whole file system in tree structure
     takes too many time, only the directories which are direct
     ancestors and the direct sub directories are displayed,
     first in the tree screen.  In the directories which are
     direct ancestors, the other sub directories (if exists) are
     grouped as "......".  These grouped sub directories will be
     expanded automatically when a cursor is placed on its posi-
     tion.

     The sub directories which are not expanded yet are
     represented with '>>' trailing the filename, which shows as
     they are.  Such directory is never expanded until it is
     required to expand explicitly, then you should expand it by
     the following key inputs before moving to any hidden sub
     directory.

     In the tree screen, the following key inputs are available.
          UUpp, DDoowwnn  Move a cursor.
          RRiigghhtt     Expand the sub directory on the cursor posi-
                    tion.
          TTaabb       Expand the sub directory on the cursor posi-
                    tion recursively.
          PPaaggeeUUpp, PPaaggeeDDoowwnn
                    Move a cursor by half screen.
          HHoommee(<), EEnndd(>)
                    Move a cursor to the top/bottom of tree.
          ??         Move a cursor to the current directory.
          BBss        Move a cursor to the parent directory.
          LLeefftt      Group sub directories of the directory on the
                    cursor position, or move a cursor to the
                    parent directory.
          ((, ))      Move a cursor to the previous/next directory
                    among the same level sub directories.
          AA - ZZ     Move a cursor to the directory whose name
                    starts with the character or its lowercase.
          ll         Change the directory tree into the specified
                    directory.  Moving to the floppy drive is
                    also available.
          ^^LL        Redraw the tree structure.
          RReettuurrnn    Select the directory.
          EEsscc       Cancel.

     When directories are recursively expanded, the machine
     operation is so late that it maybe seems to freeze.  In this
     case, you can input any key while operating.  If key input
     is recognized while expanding directories, expanding has
     been stopped at that moment in spite of not finishing.  Even
     if key repeat keeps effective, any operation will be delayed
     for this function.

          SSppaaccee TTaabb 0 or more characters of spaces or tabs

     In this description, the field means the area separated by
     spaces, tabs or newlines.  When the string which indicates
     each information is separated by these characters, you can
     simply describe the above string which indicates that field.
     When the string is separated by another character, you
     should describe the above string with that separator.  You
     can describe to indicate the field length as numeric, such
     as %_1_0_a.  This example means that the field which indicates
     a file mode consists of 10 characters.  If you describe it
     with a character ** as the field length instead of numeric,
     such as %*_f, the string to the end of line is regarded as a
     field, in which any space and tab will be ignored.

     When a field may have the different meanings according to
     situation, you should describe it quoted with {{ }}, such as
     %{_y_t}.  This example means that this field indicates a crea-
     tion year or a creation time.  When the information for 1
     file consists of multiple lines, you should place a \\nn on
     the position of newline in the format string.

     For example, the following are the format strings for the
     list of some archivers.  While some spaces are used here for
     easiness to see, these spaces are not always necessary
     because any space between fields is ignored.
     `llhhaa ll'           "%9a %u/%g %s %x %m %d %{yt} %f"
     `llhhaa vv' (MS-DOS)  "%f\n%s %x %x %y-%m-%d %t"
     `ttaarr ttvvff' (BSD)   "%9a %u/%g %s %m %d %t %y %f"
     `ttaarr ttvvff' (SVR4)  "%a %u/%g %s %m %d %t %y %f"

     If you register archive browsers with above format, in the
     builtin command of EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH or in the initial configura-
     tion file, you can use the archive browser which is not
     prepared by default.  But, if you want to execute or view
     files in the archive file, you must register the archiver
     command for the archive file, too, don't forget this.

     On some OS, ttaarr(1) may output the Japanese timestamp when
     _j_a_p_a_n_e_s_e is substituted for LLAANNGG the environment variable.
     Since ffdd cannot analyze the representation like this, you
     should describe `_e_x_p_o_r_t _L_A_N_G=_C' in the initial configuration
     file, or specify LLAANNGG in the description of listing command,
     such as `_L_A_N_G=_C _t_a_r _t_v_f'.

     You can access the MS-DOS formatted floppy disk, by
     representing to prefix "_c::" to the directory name.  But, it
     is necessary to register the floppy drive and set DDOOSSDDRRIIVVEE
     the environ variable which makes this function effective, in
     advance.

     Each registered drive is distinguished with the drive name.
     You should tag the physically different drive as the dif-
     ferent drive name.  When the same physical drive supports
     multiple formats, you can register each format with the same
     drive name, or the different drive name each other.  If you
     tag the same drive name, the justice of the format is tried
     in registered order, so that you should register the format
     which you often use in the first place.

     Each drive of the floppy drive has the its own current
     directory.  The default value of this is a root directory,
     and the current directory is moved back to a root directory
     again whenever you change a floppy disk.  When you describe
     the directory name as starting with '/' after '::', it means
     the absolute path representation of that drive.  If this '/'
     is not exist, it means the relative path representation from
     the current directory of that drive, don't forget this.

     Regrettably, some internal commands like as WWRRIITTEE_DDIIRR,
     IINNFFOO_FFIILLEESSYYSS cannot support the floppy drive.  Some
     filenames are renamed when they are copied from UNIX for
     reason of the filename length limit.

     When you use a lowercase letter as the drive name, you can
     access it as the floppy drive which can treat the Long File
     Name (LFN) for MS-Windows formatted floppy disk.  In this
     case, you can copy a file with a long filename on UNIX as it
     is.  But, when the UNICODE translation table ffdd--uunniiccdd..ttbbll is
     not exist in the same directory as the invoked ffdd exists,
     any Kanji filename cannot be treated as LFN representation.
     Reversely, when you use a uppercase letter as the drive
     name, LFN is ignored and 8+3 formed filename is treated.
     MS-DOS version inherits this specification by the case of a
     drive name.

     When you input the string, such as the pathname, the follow-
     ing key inputs are available.  The kind of referred history
     differs with the input string required.  In the split window
     mode, the current directory of another window is always
     placed on the top of the pathname history.

     EEooll       Move a cursor to the end of string.
     IInnss       Switch a input method to the insert/overwrite
               mode.  (Default value is the insert mode.)
     DDeell       Delete a character on the cursor position.
     BBss        Delete a character before the cursor position.
     DDeellLLiinnee   Delete a string after the cursor position.
     IInnssLLiinnee   Treat the next input character as it is, effective

               lowercase.
     TTaabb       Complete a pathname, a command name or a variable
               name on the cursor position.
               When there are two or more completion choices,
               inputting this continuously can display the com-
               pletion choice list.  Except for command line in
               the internal shell, you can make a choice from
               this list with cursor keys and [RReettuurrnn].
     ^^LL        Redraw the input string.

     EEsscc       Cancel.

     The inputted string is expanded before evaluation as follow-
     ing.  These expansions are also valid in the string of com-
     mand macros.  But these expansions are restrained in the
     string quoted with the quotation mark ''.

     $${{_N_A_M_E}} Indicate the value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable or
             the environment variable.  When both are defined,
             the internal variable is prior.  When both are unde-
             fined, it is replaced a null.  The brace {{ }}
             separates _N_A_M_E from its trailing characters.

             When _N_A_M_E is the following character, it is replaced
             by the value substituted automatically by the shell.

             If the value except a null is substituted for _N_A_M_E
             the internal variable or the environment variable,
             it is replaced by _w_o_r_d, otherwise it is replaced by

     $${{_N_A_M_E??_w_o_r_d}}
             If any value is substituted for _N_A_M_E the internal

     $${{##_N_A_M_E}}
             It is replaced by the length in characters of the
             value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable or the environ-
             ment variable.  If _N_A_M_E is ** or @@, it is replaced by
             the number of positional parameters instead of the
             length of characters.

     $${{_N_A_M_E%%_w_o_r_d}}
             It is replaced by the string in which the smallest
             portion of the suffix matched by the _w_o_r_d pattern is
             deleted from the value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable
             or the environment variable.  If _N_A_M_E is ** or @@,
             each positional parameter is replaced.  ( \\ is used
             instead of %% on MS-DOS version.)

     $${{_N_A_M_E%%%%_w_o_r_d}}
             It is replaced by the string in which the largest
             portion of the suffix matched by the _w_o_r_d pattern is
             deleted from the value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable
             or the environment variable.  If _N_A_M_E is ** or @@,
             each positional parameter is replaced.  ( \\\\ is used
             instead of %%%% on MS-DOS version.)

     $${{_N_A_M_E##_w_o_r_d}}
             It is replaced by the string in which the smallest
             portion of the prefix matched by the _w_o_r_d pattern is
             deleted from the value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable
             or the environment variable.  If _N_A_M_E is ** or @@,
             each positional parameter is replaced.

     $${{_N_A_M_E####_w_o_r_d}}
             It is replaced by the string in which the largest
             portion of the prefix matched by the _w_o_r_d pattern is
             deleted from the value of _N_A_M_E the internal variable
             or the environment variable.  If _N_A_M_E is ** or @@,
             each positional parameter is replaced.

     \\_c      It indicates a character _c itself.  You can use it
             when you want to use the preceding meta-character as
             a character with no evaluation, such as ~~ or $$.  You
             can describe \\ itself as "\\\\".  But, on MS-DOS ver-
             sion, because \\ which is used as the pathname delim-
             iter must be treat as well as the normal character,
             %%_c is expediently used in place of \\.

     The following is replaced only in the shell which is exe-
     cuted by EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH and EEXXEECCUUTTEE_FFIILLEE.

     ``_l_i_s_t``  _l_i_s_t is executed and this string is replaced by its

     $$((_l_i_s_t)) _l_i_s_t is executed and this string is replaced by its
             standard output like as ``_l_i_s_t``.  This differs from
             ``_l_i_s_t`` in the point that nested expressions are
             allowed.  And any meta-characters such as quotes in
             _l_i_s_t are evaluated as it is.

     $$((((_e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n))))
             _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n the arithmetic expression is evaluated
             and this string is replaced by its result value.
             You can specify numeric values, variables and
             integral calculations with the following operators
             in _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.

     ??
     **
     [[
     ]]       The string including these letters is pattern-
             matched with existent files.  When it is matched, it
             is replaced by all of the matched filenames which
             are sorted in alphabetical order.
             ??    Match any single character except //.
             **    Match any 0 or more length string not including
                  //.
             ****   Match any 0 or more length string including //.
             [[...]]
                  Match any one of the characters enclosed by [[
                  ]].  When enclosed characters include --, it
                  matches any character whose character code is
                  between characters before/after --.
             [[!!...]]
                  Match any one of the characters not enclosed by
                  [[ ]].

             But, when the first character of the filename is ..,
             ??, ** and **** don't match it.

     EEddiitt MMooddee
     When you want to use some functions bound to special keys,
     such as a cursor key or a scroll key, such a key doesn't
     exist in some terminals.  In such a case, substituting the
     string for EEDDIITTMMOODDEE the internal variable can make you use
     some control keys as alternative to these special keys.
     Since this alternative key function is prior to the key
     binding by the builtin command, the key binding is invalid
     for the control characters used as the alternative keys.

     You can use the following parameter macros in the string
     which is used for the registration of command macros and for
     executing command.  But, you cannot use them in the func-
     tions, the input file for ssoouurrccee command, and the initial
     configuration file, then you should use eevvaallmmaaccrroo command
     when you want to use any parameter macro in them.

     %%CC      The filename on the cursor position.  Or, it indi-
             cates the archive filename, in the macro to register
             the archiver command.

     %%XX      The filename except its extension on the cursor
             position.  Or, it indicates the archive filename
             except its extension, in the macro to register the
             archiver command.  Only the last one extension is
             removed.  TT, TTAA, MM trailing %%XX are replaced by %%TT,
             %%TTAA, %%MM except its extension respectively.  On MS-
             DOS version, you can describe a trailing SS as well
             as them.

     %%PP      The pathname of the current directory.

     %%KK      Prompt and return to ffdd after a command is finished.
             But, the meaning of %%KK is reverse in EEXXEECCUUTTEE_FFIILLEE
             and EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH; it prompts by default and doesn't
             prompt if %%KK is specified.  You can never specify to
             prompt in macros to register the archive browser of
             the launcher and macros to register the archiver
             command.

     %%TT      List marked files separated by spaces as possible.
             When files are so many that the command line exceeds
             11002233 characters, the rest of marked files are
             ignored.

     %%TTAA     List marked files as well as %%TT, and repeat the same
             command for spilt files to complete all marked
             files.

     %%MM      Execute the same command as many times as marked
             files, sending the marked file one by one.  It is
             useful to mark files by MMAARRKK_FFIINNDD and execute "mv %M
             %XM.bak" by EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH.

     %%NN      Restrain the filename addition even if the parameter
             is omitted.

     %%RR      Make you input the additional parameter in executing
             a macro, if the length of command string has enough
             margin.  The cursor position in input is placed on
             the position of %%RR in a macro.  But, %%RR is ignored
             in macros to register the archive browser of the
             launcher, macros to register the archiver command,
             and EEXXEECCUUTTEE_FFIILLEE, EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH.

     %%SS      The 8+3 formed filename with which the LFN formed
             filename on the cursor position is replaced.  You
             can use it when you use external commands which can
             treat only 8+3 formed arguments.  TT, TTAA, MM trailing
             %%SS can be described as well as %%XX.  ((DDOOSS))

     %%JJAA     The Kanji code of the string enclosed by this macro
             is converted into the Kanji code which is used in

             SSJJIISSPPAATTHH, EEUUCCPPAATTHH, etc. can specify what kanji code
             is used in each pathname.  ((UUNNIIXX))

     When no filename parameter, such as %%CC and %%TT, is taken with
     the result to expand parameter macros in a command macro,
     the filename on the cursor position is automatically added
     to the last of expanded string, as ./_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e form.  This
     addition is not done, in case of the input string for exe-
     cuting command, or when %%NN macro is specified.

                  `--_N_A_M_E==_v_a_l_u_e' form, to define the internal
                  variables.

        ..ffdd22rrcc    You can prepare the initial configuration file
                  ..ffdd22rrcc on your home directory, to execute the
                  command which is written in this file, before
                  the startup of ffdd.  You can describe builtin
                  commands and external commands in it to set up
                  each configuration.  Yet, when ffddsshh is invoked
                  as a login shell, ..ffddsshhrrcc is read instead of
                  ..ffdd22rrcc.

                  preceding ..ffdd22rrcc and ..ffddsshhrrcc.  If this file
                  exists, the initial configurations prepared by
                  a system administrator are valid unless you

                  Any valid variable name as the internal vari-
                  able can be valid to be defined as the environ-
                  ment variable in advance.  But the internal
                  variable is always prior to the environment
                  variable in ffdd.  When the same named environ-
                  ment variable is used in another application,
                  you can also use the name which FFDD_ is prefixed
                  to each environment variable for ffdd only.  This
                  environment variable with FFDD_ is always prior
                  to the environment variable without it, then
                  the definition of the environment variable with
                  FFDD_ is prior to the definition of the internal

     If you try to exit from the customizer without saving after
     changing any configuration, you will be confirmed whether if
     it is right to exit without saving.  While the changed con-

     saving, when you want them to be valid in the next invoked
     ffdd, you must save them into the initial configuration file.

     The following environment variables are valid in ffdd.  These
     environment variables can be valid if they are defined as
     the internal variables.  You can specify them as the command
     line options in `--_N_A_M_E==_v_a_l_u_e' form.  But the variables
     followed by * cannot be use with the prefix FFDD_ as the
     environment variables.

     AADDJJTTTTYY        Reset the terminal mode forcedly to the normal
                   state, when ffdd is finished.  Invoking ffdd can
                   adjust the terminal rightly from the state
                   displaying broken characters.  Any value

     AANNSSIICCOOLLOORR     Colorize the file display.  When the terminal
                   which you use supports the color control
                   escape sequence of ANSI standard, each file is
                   displayed with color according to its file
                   type.  If the value is 11, it is colorized.  If
                   the value is 22, the background color is forced
                   to be black, for the case that the foreground
                   color is the same as the background color and
                   indistinguishable.  If the value is 33, the
                   foreground color is forced to be black.

     AANNSSIIPPAALLEETTTTEE   Specify color palette according to file type
                   when the file display is colorized.  This
                   variable value consists of a numeric value
                   whose maximum columns are 1100 columns.  The
                   number of each column shows a color number,
                   which specifies the color of file type
                   corresponding with its column.  The following
                   are correspondence of the column number to the
                   file type.
                       11    normal file
                       22    background

                       88    FIFO (or label on MS-DOS)
                       99    block device
                       1100   character device

                   The following are the meaning of color number
                   specified on each column.
                       00    black
                       11    red
                       22    green
                       33    yellow
                       44    blue
                       55    magenta
                       66    cyan
                       77    white
                       88    default color for foreground
                       99    default color for background

                   The color number 88 is forced to be black, if
                   the value of AANNSSIICCOOLLOORR the variable is 33.  The
                   color number 99 is forced to be black, if the
                   value of AANNSSIICCOOLLOORR the variable is 22.

                   When the columns are less than 1100 or this
                   variable is not set, the standard color
                   palette will be applied for the file type
                   corresponding with the following columns.  The
                   standard color palette is described with the
                   above color number as 88996622443355118888.

                   when ffdd is invoked.  The default value is 22.
                   If you specify the value except 11, 22, 33 and 55,
                   it is ignored.

     DDIIRRCCOOUUNNTTLLIIMMIITT Specify the maximum number of files read from

                   directory trailed by '>>' has no sub directory,
                   the expanded result is not changed.  If the
                   number of files (including directories) in the
                   directory is within this value, the directory
                   with no sub directory is not trailed '>>' from
                   the first.  Moreover, the file list in the
                   directory displayed on the right of screen is
                   not displayed over this value.  If the value
                   is 00, you can realize a comfortable operation
                   speed even in the slow machine.  The default
                   value is 5500 files.

     DDIIRRCCMMDD*       Specify the default options used by ddiirr the

                   histories which can be referred by the direc-
                   tory input line.  The default value is 5500.  If
                   this value is 00, you can refer to no directory
                   history.

     DDIISSPPLLAAYYMMOODDEE   Specify the filename display mode of the file
                   list when ffdd is invoked.  Each of the symbolic
                   link mode, the file type symbol mode and the
                   dot file display mode can be selected indivi-
                   dually.  The default value is 00.  The follow-
                   ing are specifiable values.

                   Moreover, on the OS which supports the file
                   flag, if you specify the value adding 88 to
                   each value, you can select the file flag
                   display mode.

     DDOOSSDDRRIIVVEE      Validate the access function to the MS-DOS
                   floppy.  If no floppy drive is registered,
                   this validation cannot make you access the
                   floppy.  Any value except 00 and null effects
                   valid.

                   On MS-DOS version, This definition can make
                   you treat the LFN formed filename in the old
                   DOS before Ver. 6.xx.  In this case, you don't
                   have to register any floppy drive.  the access
                   speed may be slow or some functions may be
                   restricted for the reason to operate the disk
                   I/O not by way of OS.

     DDUUMMBBSSHHEELLLL     Don't use any control sequences to edit com-
                   mand line in the internal shell.  In the
                   internal shell, the cursor addressing of ter-
                   minal mode is not valid.  In case of some ter-
                   minal such as a console terminal, the cursor
                   addressing cannot work correctly in this ter-
                   minal mode, and the editing string is
                   displayed incorrectly.  When this variable is
                   valid, while no control sequence is used to
                   edit command line, an inefficient cursor
                   addressing will cause restriction of some
                   functions and failure of response.  Any value
                   except 00 and null effects valid.

     EEDDIITTMMOODDEE      Specify the edit mode of key input as the

     EENNVV*          Specify the additional initial configuration
                   file when invoked as ffddsshh.  You must specify

                   is set, the initial configuration file is read
                   after //eettcc//ffdd22rrcc, and before ..ffdd22rrcc or ..ffddsshhrrcc.

     LLIINNEENNOO*       Indicate the current line number.  When not in
                   a script nor function, this value cannot be
                   guaranteed to make sense.  If you uunnsseett or

                   special meaning to be treated as a general
                   variable.

     LLOOOOPPCCUURRSSOORR    Loop a cursor moving within the same page,
                   when you move a cursor.  Any value except 00
                   and null effects valid.

     MMAAIILL*         Specify the spool filename when the internal
                   shell will check new mails.  If MMAAIILLPPAATTHH is
                   set, it is prior to this.  ((UUNNIIXX))

     MMAAIILLCCHHEECCKK*    Specify the interval of checking new mails in
                   seconds, for the spool files specified by
                   MMAAIILLPPAATTHH or MMAAIILL.  The default value is 660000

                   checked before each prompt.  ((UUNNIIXX))

     MMAAIILLPPAATTHH*     Specify the multiple spool filenames, as the
                   list separated by ::, when the internal shell
                   will check new mails.  The any specified files
                   will be checked.  Each filenames can be fol-
                   lowed by %% and a arrival message of new mails.

     MMIINNFFIILLEENNAAMMEE   Specify the minimum character length of
                   filename display area in the file list.  When
                   the area enough to be specified here cannot be
                   obtained, the informations are reduced in the
                   order of UID, GID, timestamp, size.  The
                   default value is 1122 characters.

     OOPPTTAARRGG*       An option argument is substituted in ggeettooppttss
                   the builtin command.

     OOPPTTIINNDD*       Specify the index of the next parameter in

     PPAAGGEERR         Specify the pager command used for viewing
                   files.

     PPAATTHH*         Specify the search path for executing external
                   commands.  You can specify multiple paths
                   separating with '::'.

     PPPPIIDD*         Indicate the process ID of the parent proccess
                   for ffdd which is invoked first.  ((UUNNIIXX))

     PPRREECCEEDDEEPPAATTHH   Specify the file preceding function, which
                   displays only filenames before obtaining their
                   file informations, for the directory which has
                   a lot of files like as /dev.  You can specify
                   multiple pathnames separating with '::'.  You
                   are enough to specify only the top directory
                   where you want to realize the file preceding
                   function, then the file preceding function is
                   valid in all of the directories under that
                   directory.  When the file preceding function
                   is effective, any files are not sorted in that
                   directory, and file informations are obtained
                   file by file while waiting the key input.  No
                   pathname is specified by default.

     PPSS11           Specify the prompt string of input line in
                   EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH.  The default value is "$$ ".  The
                   following escape sequences are available.
                       \\uu   username ((UUNNIIXX))
                       \\hh   hostname ((UUNNIIXX))

                       \\ee   ESC (\033)
                       \\_o_o_o character indicated by the octal _o_o_o
                       \\\\   \ itself

     PPSS22           Specify the prompt string when more continuous
                   input is needed in EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH.  The default
                   value is ">> ".

     PPSS44*          Specify the prompt string with which command
                   strings are displayed when you do sseett --xx.

     PPWWDD*          The variable for the the current directory
                   with the absolute representation.  If some
                   value is set, this value will be replaced
                   automatically according to changing the cur-
                   rent directory.  If no value is set, this
                   value will remain unset.  If this is passed
                   as an environment variable when invoked, and
                   this value and the current directory indi-
                   cate the same directory logically, then it
                   is used as the default value for the current
                   directory.  It is useful when you want to
                   specify the logical pathname following sym-
                   bolic links.

     RRRRPPAATTHH        Display files under the directory mounted by
                   CD-ROM, with the pseudo ISO 9660 RockRidge
                   Extension, for the OS which cannot support
                   RockRidge Extension.  You can specify multiple
                   mount points separating with '::'.  You are
                   enough to specify only the top directory
                   mounted by CD-ROM, then the pseudo RockRidge
                   Extension function is valid in all of the
                   directories under that directory.  This is no
                   more than a pseudo extension, which only
                   replaces filenames according to TRANS.TBL, and
                   cannot handle some CD-ROM which has an incon-
                   sistent TRANS.TBL.  No mount point is speci-
                   fied by default.

     SSAAVVEEHHIISSTT      Specify the maximum number saved to the com-
                   mand history file.  The default value is 5500.
                   If this value is 00, no command history file is
                   saved.

     SSEECCOONNDD        Display the second in the clock of the title
                   line.  But the clock is adjusted correctly
                   every 1100 seconds, and some gap from the real
                   time will be occurred in this span.  Any value
                   except 00 and null effects valid.

     SSHHEELLLL*        When the filename part of this specified value
                   is rrffdd or rrffddsshh, the shell becomes a res-
                   tricted shell as well as --rr option when
                   invoked.  This variable also specify the shell
                   which can be invoked from EEXXEECCUUTTEE_SSHH.

     SSIIZZEEIINNFFOO      Display the file size information line at the
                   top of screen.  The total size displayed here
                   is not the sum of bytes but the sum of disk
                   block size occupied actually.  Any value
                   except 00 and null effects valid.

     SSOORRTTTTRREEEE      Sort directories in the tree screen.  The
                   sorted type specified by SSOORRTT_TTYYPPEE is used,
                   but they can not be sorted when it is "by
                   size" or "by timestamp".  The directory
                   included in the current directory path is
                   always placed on the top of directory tree,
                   with no regard to the sorted type.  Any value
                   except 00 and null effects valid.

     SSOORRTTTTYYPPEE      The file list in the browser screen is not
                   sorted by default, but placed in order
                   registered in the directory.  This variable
                   specify it to be sorted by default.  The fol-
                   lowing are specifiable values.
                       00    not sort
                       11    by filename    99    by filename(reverse)
                       22    by extension   1100   by extension(reverse)
                       33    by size        1111   by size(reverse)
                       44    by timestamp   1122   by timestamp(reverse)

                       110000--111133   keep the last sorted type

                   If you specify the value of 100-113, it is
                   sorted according to the value indicated by
                   lower 2 digits just after invoked, the last
                   specified sorted type is kept when moving
                   directory.

     TTEERRMM*         Specity the terminal name.  When this value
                   is dduummbb, uunnkknnoowwnn or uunn, it is regarded as
                   the dumb terminal to suppress any escape
                   sequences in the internal shell in spite of
                   DDUUMMBBSSHHEELLLL.  If this value does not exist in
                   tteerrmmccaapp(5) and tteerrmmiinnffoo(5) entry, it is exe-
                   cutable only when it is invoked as ffddsshh.
                   The terminal name will be variable dynami-
                   cally, then you can re-specify the suitable
                   one as this value after invoked for some
                   strange terminal display and key input.

     TTMMPPDDIIRR        Specify the working directory where the
                   archiver command temporarily unpack files in
                   the archive file.  The default value is //ttmmpp.

                   (On MS-DOS version, The default value is `..'.)

     TTMMPPUUMMAASSKK      Specify the file creation mask with octal
                   expression for files and directories created
                   temporarily in TTMMPPDDIIRR.  But the mask value set
                   by uummaasskk the builtin command is prior, then
                   actual mask value is the logical OR of this
                   value and uummaasskk value.

     TTRRAADDLLAAYYOOUUTT    Use the traditional screen layout based on the
                   original "FD".  In this layout, the file size
                   information will be always displayed, whether
                   SSIIZZEEIINNFFOO is set or not.  When the screen width
                   is less than 8800 columns, this specification is
                   invalid.  Any value except 00 and null effects
                   valid.

     UUNNIICCOODDEEBBUUFFFFEERR Hold the UNICODE translation table on memory.
                   It will be fast to access the floppy drive and
                   to translate from/to UTF-8.  You should set
                   this if you have enough memory.  Any value
                   except 00 and null effects valid.

     UUSSEEGGEETTCCUURRSSOORR  Use the VT100 compatible escape sequence get-
                   ting the cursor position in order to get the
                   terminal size.  When the screen size of ffdd
                   doesn't correspond with the terminal size,
                   this variable can be sometimes valid.  On some
                   terminals which don't support the escape
                   sequence getting the cursor position, the
                   operation may be stopped.  In this case, it is
                   continued by inputting 'R' from the keyboard.
                   Any value except 00 and null effects valid.

     WWRRIITTEEFFSS       Forbid use of WWRRIITTEE_DDIIRR command.  If the value
                   is 11, the directory is written only when the
                   command is executed intentionally, and you are
                   not confirmed after arranging the file order.
                   If the value is 22, even writing by the command
                   is invalid, the directory writing is quite

     ffdd processes the Kanji character-set to input/output as
     "EUC-JP" or "Shift JIS" according to setting in compile.
     The the pathname including Kanji is displayed in considera-
     tion for the 2nd byte character in Kanji.  You can dynami-
     cally select Kanji code to input/output with LLAANNGGUUAAGGEE,
     IINNPPUUTTKKCCOODDEE and FFNNAAMMEEKKCCOODDEE the internal variable.  You can
     input Kanji string with some Japanese input methods.

     You can use Kanji in the command macro and the command
     string, but cannot use Kanji as the value of the internal
     variables.  You cannot use the multibyte symbol character as
     the meta character, such as '%%' and '""' and so on, Kanji
     character is not counted as 1 character in the wildcard
     search.

     And when you give the non-standard Kanji code for the OS to
     the shell with the parameter macro such as %%JJJJ, some Kanji
     is converted into the code including the meta character such
     as '$$' and '\\' and so on, to cause unexpected behavior.  In
     that case, you can probably avoid it by quoting the string
     to be converted with %%''.

     The original "FD" for MS-DOS was created and released by
     A.Idei <SDI00544@niftyserve.or.jp> for the first time, in
     1989.  ffdd was created for UNIX from scratch following that
     implementation, in 1995.

     The maximum key bindings which you can register is 225566, and
     the maximum that with the user defined macro is 6644.  The
     maximum launchers which you can register is 3322, including
     archive browsers.  The maximum archive commands which you
     can register is 1166 pairs, with pack and unpack in pairs.
     These maximum values include default builtin definitions.

     Some terminals cannot send the input of certain function
     keys and special keys.  The sequence compatible with VVTT220000
     is assigned as the default sequence which is not registered
     in tteerrmmccaapp(5), and when the terminal cannot support this,
     the key receipt or the screen control due to be brought by
     this is not available.

     When files in an archive file are packed with a pathname
     including "..", the archive browser cannot work normally.
     The symbolic links in an archive file cannot be unpacked
     individually.

     The user interface is cheap.
